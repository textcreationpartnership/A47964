            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Was ſo well ſatisfied with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic Approbations, that thoſe learned Phyſicians have honour'd me with to give my Book, that I was reſolved to make no Preface: but an accident happen'd, which I thought convenient to make known to the Reader. A certain Perſon who paſſes for a Man of great Merit, and who is actually in a Poſt to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh himſelf, deſir'd, ſome both of his and my Friends, that ſomething might be ſaid in this Tract to his advantage. I was in no great trouble to grant him his Deſire; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to flatter my ſelf that he had
<pb facs="tcp:110043:4"/>ſome eſteem for my Work: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs he has publickly declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, againſt that he had ſo well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in particular; and many honeſt Gentlemen have been ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized at his ill Temper, as well as my ſelf. One may well think, he imagined that this Book, would not have the ſucceſs it deſerves, and he has reproached me to have made uſe of his Writings: Its no way diſadvantagious to me, that a man of his Rank ſhould attribute to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Fruit of my Labours. In the mean time the Reader will very eaſily ſee, that I am no ill temper'd Man, nor any way troubleſome, ſince in thoſe things which are not my own, I have cited the Authors, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which one will not find the name of the <hi>Sieur Du</hi> — its likely he himſelf has made uſe of the thoughts of the aforeſaid Great men, but has not been ſo ingenuous in owning it as I. Nothing's ſo ſtrange as Pride! It often carries
<pb facs="tcp:110043:4"/>us, to ſome exceſs which ſerves but the more to make our Faults and Weakneſſes better known. I'll ſay nothing of my Book, only I believe I have advanced little but what's founded upon Reaſon and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which I'll clearly demonſtrate according to the Structure of the Parts. I deſire the Reader to judge of it without prejudice, and that he would not eſteem Mr. <hi>Du</hi> — to be the Author of the good it contains.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO TEH READER.</head>
            <p>WE have an Engliſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, though ſomewhat obſolete, yet true, which is, <hi>That good Wine needs no Buſh;</hi> the ſame I think may well be ſaid of this little Treatiſe, whoſe every line draws a ſufficient Characteriſtic Note after it, without being uſher'd in with any Prefatory Diſcourſe to raiſe its value; yet ſince Prefaces (in this Age) are as much in Faſhion as a pair of Gates before a ſtately pile
<pb facs="tcp:110043:6"/>of Buildings, I hope a few lines will not be amiſs, to do the Author ſome juſtice in ſo admirable a Tract as this is. I ſhall not pretend to write here an Encomium in the Praiſes of Chyrurgery, nor indeed can I give it thoſe due Graces it worthily deſerves, it having been already (by ſuch a Cloud of learned Men) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to my hand, whoſe moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Footſteps I can follow, (and thoſe only at a diſtance) not pretend in the leaſt to imitate. As for the Contents of this Book, they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly praiſe worthy, the Author be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo famous a Practitioner, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall in the performing Chyrurgical Operations, his Works ſhew him to be a Man of ſound Judgment and Learning; for he handles the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with ſuch ſtrenuous Arguments, ſound Reaſonings and ſo home, that I greatly admire none attempted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now to give it an Engliſh Garb, when I firſt peruſed it, and finding it applicable to what I had
<pb facs="tcp:110043:6"/>ſeen, eſpecially of late by an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gentleman of that Nation, I was reſolved to make it ſpeak our Mother Tongue, never deſigning it for a Preſs, only as a help in my own Buſineſs; it having been Tranſlated above fifteen Months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it came to the Publick View; and perhaps never had by me, but that the Importunities of many Friends almoſt (if I may ſo ſay) forced me to it, beſides hearing one or two were on the Deſign of render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into Engliſh, I thought it might be as well on my ſide, ſeeing it had been ſo long done, as theirs. It muſt for certain be of great Benefit to our younger Students in the Chyrurgical Art, (though our Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors may not be aſhamed of having ſo pretious a Jewel about them) who have not the opportunity of ſeeing many Operations perform'd, and thoſe few Authors which have treated of them, have done it ſo ſlightly and ſuperficially, that after
<pb facs="tcp:110043:7"/>all your Study and Pains, you are as far to ſeek as ever, but this Tract is ſo exact, and Methodical, that it leads you (as it were) by the hand through the whole Courſe of every particular Operation, as well as if you ſaw it perform'd by any learned Artiſts: it not only demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates how to perform the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions according to Art, but alſo ſhews the Diſtemper, explicates their Signes, Cauſes, Signes of thoſe Cauſes, and Symptoms, according to the neweſt Syſtem of Philoſophy, founded on the Mechanic Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Parts.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. I.</hi> Of Operations in General.</head>
               <p>AMong all the Parts of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, there is none ſo profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table as this which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to treat of.<note place="margin">VVhat it teaches.</note> It teaches us how we ought to perform the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of Surgery, it explains the chief Pathologic Phaenomena, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies us in the knowledge of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:110043:8"/>on which we practice? and I dare boldly ſay, that without the aſſiſtance of theſe Operations, the Art of Surgery would never have arrived to ſo high a point of perfection, which at this time it has atain'd; and without it, the Knowledge which relates to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Principal Diſtempers,<note place="margin">The Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Chyrurgical Operations.</note> would have been only dubious and uncertain, if light were not borrowed from hence by evident Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and by reaſons which experience authoriſes. It's a ſtudy which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains nothing but what's worthy to entertain our Wits, and engages thoſe who love the Profeſſion, to ſhew the advantages we receive from it. It's this which recommends the Artiſt, who dexterouſly reunites the Parts divided, who divides thoſe diſcreetly that are united, who draws together with an extraordinary care, thoſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which in reſpect one to another are ſtrange, and who with Art and Induſtry ſupplies whatever are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our perfection, whence the end which he ought to propoſe to himſelf, is to perform well theſe four Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to diſentangle all the difficulties they contain, and to obſerve all the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110043:8"/>circumſtances which are precedent, concomitant, and which follow, in order to maintain the parts in their union and natural Situation.</p>
               <p>Here I have a large Field to dilate my-ſelf into the praiſes of Surgery; but (beſides that the ſhortneſs of time does not permit me) I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I dare not undertake it, leaſt I ſhould ſink under the weight of ſo painful an enterprize; for all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who have wrote of it, and boaſted of their Excellency in this Art, were never able to give it thoſe due Encomiums which are propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the great advantages we find in it: wherefore I ſhall ſtick cloſe to my Subject, and I dare ſay that if theſe new Anatomiſts, who have made ſuch great and wonderful diſcoveries, had made a due and juſt application of them to the Art of Surgery, and if thoſe great Practiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, had enrich'd it with their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, we ſhould have found ſuch advantages, which will never be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they change their Principles: But the Subject being ſo thorny and difficult, we find very few, who are willing to cummunicate to us their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110043:9"/>Ideas, and particular Diſcoveries. Moſt do but treat of theſe matters ſuperficially, and without diving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bottom, which is the reaſon that oft-times we caſt the difficulty of the Art, upon the evil diſpoſition of the ſubject: I acknowledge that it's very hard to hit always right, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Nature is often various in her motions, and works in ſuch hidden corners, and by ways ſo little known, that ſhe deſtroys by ſome unexpected ſtroke (which we do not foreſee) the whole Oeconomy of her Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>

               <p>By the temper, I mean a certain diſpoſition of parts, that conſiſts in the order of theſe reſorts or ſprings which compoſe them,<note place="margin">VVhat the Tempers.</note> and in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of their Pores, proportionable to the nature of thoſe liquors which paſs thro' them, and of their motion, ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs rapid.</p>

               <p>It would be hard to underſtand how this nouriſhing Juyce whoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is Homogeneal, can be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to the maintaining ſo great a number of different parts, if by what we have ſaid of their Structure, we did not conceive that this juyce tho' indifferent, can eaſily become Fleſh, an Artery, Membrane, Bone, Tendon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according as its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified paſſing thro' the inſenſible Chanels (which muſt be regarded as ſo many little threads) where it's ſhap'd and fram'd differently accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Configuration of their Poroſities; juſt as the parts of the

               <p>This being ſuppos'd and well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, I ſay that the Surgeons Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (whether in the Reunion, in loſſes of ſubſtance, or finally in what occaſion ſoever) ſerves for nothing but to Rectifie this Sap, by the way of general Medicines (when 'tis corrupted;) and Topics, which have the vertue of conſerving the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Purity of the nouriſhing Juyce, which the Arteries carry to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Part, and to defend it in the ſame time from the impreſſions of the Air; therefore the Traumaticks, Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coticks, Carminatives, and Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, which Surgeons uſe in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, Progreſs, State, and declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wounds do produce ſuch effects as I ſhall prove in explaining their vertues.</p>

               <p>Finally, all the Threads being paſt, you muſt begin to tye that in the middle, making preſently a ſingle knot, on the firmeſt ſide, and where the matter is leaſt apt to run; over that, apply a little compreſs of Linnen, on which make another knot, which I believe more uſeful than the Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's knot (which only conſiſts in twice paſſing the Thread through the ſame knot) becauſe if any Accident ſhould happen, it could be more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily united, then make a ſlip knot, and ſo of the reſt.</p>

In theſe kind of Accidents, the <hi>Tendon</hi> is wholly cut, or in part only, if the former, 'tis evident that the Symptoms are not ſo bad, and that it ſuffers neither Tenſion, Tumor, nor Fluxion, but withdraws ſomewhat into the Fleſh, and increaſes a little in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But if the latter, the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are very dangerous, becauſe the <hi>Fibres</hi> that remain deſtitute of their wonted aſſiſtants, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be broken and torn in the ſenſible Contraction of the Muſcles, or at leaſt ſuffer ſuch violent tenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that cruel Accidents ſpeedily ariſe; beſides that, the Blood ſpilt,<note place="margin">Accidents attending wounded Tendons.</note> in the Intervals of the <hi>Fibres,</hi> does Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Saline Particles, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Tendinous <hi>Fibres</hi> divide

                  <note place="margin">Caſe of Pain.</note>The Pain is not excited, but by the continual Divulſion of the little inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>Fibrils,</hi> like that which one feels ſometime after the cut of a Sword, this does not proceed from the firſt diviſion, but by thoſe which are made through the action of the ſharp and extravaſated Humours,<note place="margin">No Pain without So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of continuity.</note> ſo that as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as the Animal feels pain; there are ſome diviſions made, by which means the Soul (which watches and intereſts it ſelf in the conſervation of the parts of our Bodies) is afflicted.</p>

               <p>If it happen that the Extremity of one part be ſo far ſhrunk into the Fleſh, that it cannot be brought to the other by the Forceps, it would be convenient to molifie the <hi>Fibres</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle with ſome Oyls extracted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fire, as <hi>Ol.

               <p>The <hi>Tendons</hi> being molified, you muſt Stitch if you can, and ſeeing they are Compos'd of little <hi>Fibres,</hi>

               <p>After the Surgeon has put the part in a convenient Situation, a Servant muſt uphold one Extremity with the

               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:110043:25"/>
               <p>The Wounds of the Belly, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther big or little, Superficial or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating, are made with or without the hurt of the contein'd Parts, which very often come out of the Cavity, according to their indiſpoſition; greatneſs of the Wound, more or leſs motion as we are going to explain.</p>
               <p>We conjecture there is ſome part damag'd according to the Figure of the Inſtrument wounding; you may judge what Parts are hurt by the Situation of the Wound, and by that in which the Patient was when received.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Signs of the wounded Viſcera.</note>But the true Signs which indicate the diviſion of ſome Internal Parts, are acute Pains, <hi>Inflammation, Fever,</hi> or ſome Matter coming forth; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, all theſe Signs are equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, except the leaſt, which is known by the Colour, Smell, and conſiſtence of the Matter, which is diſcharg'd out of the Wound, or flows in the Cavity of the Belly.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">After what manner the Viſcera get out of the Belly.</note>But as the moſt of theſe parts are floating and always Relax'd, they get out of their Cavity at the leaſt impreſſion, or diſorder, particularly at the time of expiration, when the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax</hi> contracts: Though it ſeems that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:110043:26"/>they ſhould rather eſcape in the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration when the Diaphragm is level'd, puſhing back, as the Antagoniſt of the Muſcles of the lower Belly, all the parts that are under it, yet its certain that the Muſcles of the lower Belly oblige them againſt their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral motion and inclination, to come out of the Wound in time of expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when they preſs all the contein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts of the Belly: This being ſo, 'tis evident that it's neceſſary for the part, that is under the Muſcle and out of Action, to regurgitate and ſhew it ſelf out of the Wound, as a piece of Paſte does between the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, when ſqueez'd with the Hand, whereof depend thoſe frequent Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations, and dangerous Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>You muſt alſo remark, that theſe parts are extream ſpungy and greezy, whoſe Texture is very looſe, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mected with a quantity of Humours, bedewed with an infinite number of Veſſels, and conſequently very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Putrefaction, for the Air com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſtrike and penetrate their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, they fail not to Tumefie and Condenſe the Blood which animates
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:110043:26"/>them, if they be too long expos'd to it: Theſe Parts being therefore depriv'd of the motion of the Blood, in which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts their Heat and Life, there muſt needs happen a mortification.</p>
               <p>Beſides the action of the Air, we know that Inflammation is capable of cauſing the ſtrangulation and mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: It's eaſie to conceive that the parts being inflam'd and ſwell'd muſt take up more room than before, and preſs the Inteſtine and Omentum, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly found in the paſſage,<note place="margin">Cauſe of the Inflation of the Inteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a.</note> from which muſt follow interruption of the courſe of the Blood and Spirits in thoſe parts, and conſequently Gangreens. It often happens that the Inteſtine is inflated, the cauſe of which proceeds from the Inflammation, which the Wound com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates to the Gut, and the Air Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs the Pores; beſides, the return of the Venal Blood, is in a manner ſtopt by the Strangulation, and the little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is to be ſeen there.</p>
               <p>The Inflammation which attacks the Gut, is capable of Rarifying a part of the Seroſity, (and the other Juyces which are contain'd there, whoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made more ſlow) not being able to eſcape, by reaſon of the Air
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:110043:27"/>which ſtops all the paſſages, and ſhuts the Pores of the Inteſtine, ſo that 'tis impoſſible for the Surgeon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them without dilating the Wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late when too narrow.</note>To perform which, the Surgeon muſt paſs a hollow Probe between the lip of the Wound and Inteſtine, and ſlip a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory all along the hollow of the Probe; but before he makes the Inciſion, it will be convenient to examine whether the Gut be not engaged, leſt he wound it: This being known, he may boldly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Wound, and cut as much off the Peritonaeum as of the Muſcles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe the Strangulation is every where equal, againſt their Opinion who pretend 'tis more conſiderable without, than within. I ſhan't here ſpeak of the precautions which the Ancients took, in applying Fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſeveral other Medicines: But ſuppoſe it neceſſary to Foment, and warm the parts with hot Clothes, or with Wine.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">If the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum be altered, cut off the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified part.</note>Before you reduce them, you muſt examine whether they ben't hurt, and if the Omentum be not mortified, which is known by its Lividity, then without delay, cut off the Gangreen'd
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:110043:27"/>part, after having made the Ligature of that which is ſound.</p>
               <p>If there be a little Wound in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine, it requires no Suture; if it's big, uſe the interrupted, for the <hi>Skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>'s Stitch is not approv'd of.</p>
               <p>In my Opinion, there's nothing that ſooner cures the wounds of the Guts, and procures quicker unition, than a true and exact Diet; and I find nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes more to it, than in ordering the Patient to lie on his Belly, taking care to have a kind of Bolſter under the Wound, to facilitate the running out of the Matter: Every one knows,<note place="margin">In wound of the Belly, a ſpare Diet to be uſed.</note> there's nothing more contrary to union, than motion: By the Diet we leſſen the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Inteſtines, and by the Situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that of the Muſcles of the Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: the reaſon is, that in this Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all the parts within, lie heavy on the Peritonaeum and Muſcles, and ſo diminiſh part of their motion. You muſt Obſerve, that Wounds of the Guts are never Reunited, except to the ☜ Neighbouring Guts, and other nigh parts, as Peritonaeum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which reaſon, 'tis convenient to paſt a Needle arm'd with wax'd Thread under the Body of the Gut through the Meſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terium,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:110043:28"/>chuſing a place moſt free from Veſſels, to pull it gently towards the Peritonaeum, to which it will eaſily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here.</p>
               <p>Having obſerv'd theſe circumſtances, ſearch for that part of the Gut which is neareſt the Mouth of the Wound,<note place="margin">How to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Gut.</note> and reduce it with your Fore-finger into the Cavity of the Belly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you pull that back, introduce the other; and after this manner puſh it ſucceſſively till in its natural place. The Ancients uſed to ſhake to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, that the parts might return to their former Situation. We always leave out of the Wound a part of the Ligature of the Omentum, which we place on that ſide where the Matter runs leaſt, and we make the interrupted Suture; hence come the name of <hi>Gaſtroraphia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How to make the Suture of the Belly.</note>You muſt have two crooked Needles arm'd with the ſame Thread, then with your left Hand hold the Peritonaeum, and the other integuments, and taking a Needle with your right, paſs it from within, outwards, on one lip, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lifting your Finger, paſs the other on the oppoſite ſide as the firſt. You muſt make as many Stitches as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, leaving ſome ſpace to put a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:110043:28"/>Tent in, on that ſide where the Matter takes its courſe, if there be any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Suppuration, which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happens, if the Omentum or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine be any way alter'd: Having examin'd all theſe circumſtances, you begin with the middle Stitch, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
               <p>The Sutures being made, you muſt apply a Pledgit dip'd in ſome Balm, or ſpirituous Liquor, making a light em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brocation with <hi>Ol.

The next day inſtead of uſing Aſtringents, 'tis good to uſe Emollient, and reſolving Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to hinder Tenſion,<note place="margin">Tenſion a dreadful Symptom.</note> which is a dreadful Symptom; for the edges of the Wound endeavouring to retire, cauſe extream pain, and often break the Thread; therefore you muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it ſo, as to be able to ſtraiten it after the Inflammation's over.</p>
               <p>Emollient Clyſters are of great uſe, not only becauſe they relax the <hi>Fibres,</hi> and evacuate the Matter, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they refreſh, and ſerve as a <hi>Balneum Marie,</hi> to calm the motion of the Blood and Spirits, and hinder the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:110043:29"/>progreſs of Accidents. 'Tis ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, that Bleeding and general Remedies are not to be neglected.</p>
               <p>If the edges become Callous, dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtives are wonderful, becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax the <hi>Fibres,</hi> take away Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and facilitate the generation of the fleſhy Veſicles, and conſequently the cure of the Wound.</p>
               <p>Concerning this Operation, 'twill not be amiſs to tell you further, that a wounded Perſon that has a Portion of the Inteſtine carried away, wou'd Die infallibly, if the Surgeon by his indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry does not ſo diſpoſe the Gut, to let the contain'd Matter run out; that is, he muſt ſhew the Gut to the Peritonaeum, and Teguments which make a kind of Anus, that gives the Excrements liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to come forth through the Wound, unleſs Nature ſhould work by its ſelf, as it happen'd to a Soldier in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valids</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> which ſerves us for an Example.</p>

The Anaſarca conſiſts in the ſwelling of the whole Body, and the other only in one part: You muſt obſerve, that in Anaſarca and falſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites, the teguments only are alter'd, whereas the true Aſcites poſſeſſes the whole capacity of the Belly: When I ſay the teguments are only alter'd, 'tis that you may obſerve, that the Body of the Muſcles is not penetrated: Tho' 'tis true, the water ſwims on the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and it's obſerved in the opening, thoſe who Die of a Dropſie, that their <hi>Fibres</hi> are whitiſh, as well as the

                     <hi>1.</hi> Indigeſtion of the Chyle.</note>I begin, firſt with Indigeſtion of the Chyle, which almoſt always proceeds from the alteration of the diſſolvents that ſerve for the preparation, and the conſummation of their Oyl and Viſcoſity; when the Chyle is well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:110043:31"/>prepar'd and freed from the courſe Particles, it's nothing but a But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery Maſs which paſſes into the <hi>venae Lacteae,</hi> and from thence into the right Ventricle of the Heart, to be united with the Blood which comes from all parts deprived of its Oyl and moſt active Principles, and ſerves for a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle and Balm for new nouriſhment. It is this Lactaceous Liquor well depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and extreamly fluid, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains the parts, and which by its mixture unites and ties in the Heart the two ſubſtances of Blood, <hi>viz.</hi> the white part to the red; which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances well joyned make a whole, neither too fluid, nor ſolid, but ſuch as Nature judges moſt proper to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate without Obſtacle in the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. But if by chance, the Oyl of the Blood, and other Humours (with which it's furniſh'd) ſhould happen to be diſſipated, either by violent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, too ſerious Meditations, extream Grief, or by the abundance and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Salts; the Chyle muſt of neceſſity grow ſour, become Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, ſerous, and incapable of any Union; then it's ſo far from preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the conſiſtence of the Blood, that

                     <hi>3.</hi> The Lympha.</note>In the third place, I ſaid that the Lympha diſpoſes it ſelf in the Veins to make the Blood more fluid and fit to circulate: No 'tis certain, if its
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:110043:32"/>courſe be impeded, either in the Glands or Lymphatic Veſſels, the Blood wou'd circulate much ſlower, for want of a diſſolvent. This being ſuppos'd, that Indigeſtion of the Blood, ſlow and dull Pulſation of the Arteries, weak motion of the Muſcles, and interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the courſe of the Lympha, are cauſes which concur ſomewhat to Impede the Circulation of the Venal Blood,<note place="margin">The Venal Blood very poor.</note> which is a Blood depriv'd of its Spirituous Particles, having no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence or ſtrait Union between them: Then the ſeroſity which ſerves the reſt of the Blood as a Matrix, ſeparates it ſelf from it, as the ſeroſities of Milk from the Curd; it tranſpires between the intervals of the <hi>Fibres,</hi> or pours it ſelf out as a gentle Rain in ſome capacity, for to frame both kinds of Dropſies.</p>
               <p>Two Experiments confirm me in this Opinion. The firſt is, That if we make the Ligature of the Veins in ſome part, and that one hinders the paſſage of the Blood, it does not fail to be overflown in a ſhort time.</p>

                  <note place="margin">What the Linea Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba is.</note>I'll add a word or two concerning the <hi>Linea alba,</hi> which is formed by the union of the Tendinous <hi>Fibres</hi> of the Aponeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſis of the oblique and tranſvers Muſcles which Aponeuroſis make a kind of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and mark the interval between the right Muſcles; ſo that to ſhew theſe two Muſcles, we are forc'd to cut thoſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuroſes under which they are hid: I paſs now to the action of every Muſcle in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.

               <p>After all theſe reflexions, if we make a juſt application of the cauſes of <hi>Hernias,</hi> according to the Mechaniſm of the parts where they are felt, we ſhall find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſatisfie our curioſity, confider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that violent blows, rude ſhakings, long courſes, exceſs of venery, dancing, leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and generally all efforts are capable, not only of moving the Guts, but alſo of relaxing their connexions, hence Poſts, Poſtilians, Dancers, Leapers, <hi>&amp;c</hi> are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled often with them; To theſe we have added Crying, vehement Coughs, and all too frequent expirations and inſpirations, hence, Muſicians, Singers, and Children (whoſe parts are ſoft and ſpongy,) are ſo much ſubject to them.</p>
               <p>In all theſe efforts, the Guts are ſo preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and repelled on all ſides by the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm and Muſcles of the Abdomen, which as ſo many Hands and movable Napkins, oblige the Omentum and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines to ſtrike and apply themſelves ſo ſtrongly againſt the ſurface of the Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum,

               <p>Theſe tumours are either wandring or permanent, they diſappear ſometimes, or remain always in the ſame condition. If they are wandring, 'tis a ſign of no adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and that the Inteſtines ſuffer no compreſſion, than the Bandage alone, and general Remedies well ordered, may finiſh the cure. If they be permanent, it comes from the inflammation adherence, or from ſome excrements hardned in the Inteſtines: We know when the Epiploon is faſtned there, by the ſigns ſpoken of heretofore;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:110043:47"/>which induces us to make the Operation without irritating the tumour, for it alters at the leaſt impreſſion, and it is very hard to reduce into the Hypogaſtrium.</p>
               <p>I have made you obſerve, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation and Strangulation ſucceeded the induration of the excrements contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Gut, according as it ſwells and grows thicker by the flowing of them; the ring of the external oblique, which does not obey as the others, for the reaſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mention'd, reſtrain sit proportionably as it dilates, which cauſes the Blood and Spirits not to circulate with the ſame liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Inflammation of the Inteſtine to increaſe equally with the Strangulation. You muſt alſo obſerve, that the Gut never contracts any adherency, but with the bag that makes the Hernia, unleſs ſome ſharp and ſtrange Matter has cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded it.</p>
               <p>This bag is ſometimes adherent to the cover of the Spermatic Veſſels, ſometimes to the Omentum, or to the rings of the Muſcles in all their circumference, or in ſome part only, to the Dartos, or finally to the Membranes of the Teſticles;<note place="margin">The moſt difficult part of the Operation.</note> ſo that the Inteſtine cannot return into the Belly, unleſs ſeparated by Inciſion, which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitates the Surgeon to uſe his utmoſt Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Dexterity, if he means to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

The true way to know whether there be any cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, is to queſtion the Diſeas'd, how long 'twas ſince the tumor did not diſappear, whether he feels vehement and pulſific pains, and great weight on the Teſticles.</p>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:110043:48"/>them without offending the Body of the Teſticles. You muſt obſerve, that if the Gut does not return into the Belly, 'tis not always a ſign of adherence: It may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd, or contain ſome excrements, which is the better diſtinguiſhed, becauſe we know that it had the liberty to enter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Inflammation.

                  <note place="margin">How to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the Gut from the Sack.</note>As for the precautions which we muſt obſerve to diſtinguiſh well the Inteſtine from the Sack, which forms the <hi>Hernia,</hi> its brown colour, I ſuppoſe, is the moſt convincing Sign, by reaſon of the many Blood Veſſels which irrigate them: It forms a kind of Arch which is ſenſibly
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:110043:49"/>perceived when diſcover'd; beſides if it's the Gut, the tumor leſſens: It's always thicker than the Peritonaeum, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of four Tunicles. I agree, that this Sign is equivocal, ſo much the more, becauſe the Sack of the Peritonaeum grows often to a very conſiderable thickneſs. There runs always frem the Inteſtine a thick and ſtinking Matter; whereas from the Sack of the Peritonaeum, comes only a clear and lump water. The Inteſtine obeys when you pull it, provided it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here not to the Neighbouring parts, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Peritonaeum, which obeys very little, and the Patient feels always a dull pain: Theſe are the chief Signs which ought to make a Surgeon circumſpect. I paſs to the particulars of the Operation. The Inteſtine being diſcovered, you ſlip your hollow Probe between the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Scrotum, and the Body of the Inteſtine for to widen the Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to diſcover it naked, to be able to ſeparate it the eaſier from the Teſticle: A Servant lifts the Inteſtine, and pulls it gently with his Hands towards the Pubis, whilſt the Surgeon pulls lightly the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticle with his Hand, to have the liberty to break with the Fleam, or point of the Biſtory, the Membranous ties, obſerving alway to cut them nearer to the Teſticle,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:110043:49"/>than Inteſtine: If their adherance be very ſtrong, it wou'd be better to indammage the Teſticle, becauſe it's not ſo neceſſary for Life, and the Accidents not ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; you muſt alway avoid the Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Veſſels, for fear the Blood trouble the Operation: Having freed the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine from the Teſticle, you introduce your hollow Probe between the Cutis and Inteſtine, and cut without fear to the ring of the Muſcle, where conſequently you are obliged to give way by a new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, to diſengage the Inteſtine from the Strangulation, in caſe there be any. You paſs the third time the hollow Probe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Ring and Inteſtine, ſtirring it a little to be certain that the Gut be no way engaged, and ſlip a crooked Biſtory into the hollowneſs, and you cut from the ring about two Lines, and a Portion of the skin, avoiding a little branch of an Arte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, which runs by the Aponeuroſis of this Muſcle.</p>
               <p>When you free the Inteſtine by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, you pull it out a little for to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage it from the internal rings, and give liberty to the excrements which it contains to ſpread themſelves; by this means it grows leſs tumid, and extended ſo, that the reduction of it is much more eaſie; you do it with your two Fore fingers,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:110043:50"/>and preſs not the Inteſtine too much, leſt you bruiſe it: Being reduc'd, a Servant muſt preſs with his Hands the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts, to hinder its falling out again: Some make ſeveral little Inciſions on the Circle of the Ring, all along the Purſe, which makes it incarn, and cicatrize ſtronger; others content themſelves to introduce into the Rings a thick Tent of Lint tied with a wax'd Thread, and a length proportionable to the depth of the Wound, to bruiſe them as it were, and excite a ſpeedy ſuppuration; ſome apply them dry, and others dip in ſome digeſtive, according to the pain which is felt, or humidity which relaxes theſe parts. But the true method to hinder this Diſeaſe from relapſing is, to introduce into the Wound, a long Tent of Lint, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſts the impulſion of the Inteſtine, which alway endeavours to dilate the rings, and ſo often makes the Operation unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. A Servant holds it on whilſt the Surgeon applies the reſt of the Apparatus, eſpecially, good defenſitives which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Fluxions that may happen.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral Practitioners, who wou'd, that at the ſame time the Teſticle be cut off; but this method is not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of, becauſe it contributes not to the cure of the <hi>Hernia,</hi> but rather, as Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:110043:50"/>demonſtrate, prolongs the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, makes the Patient ſuffer without ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and deprives him of the proper means of Propagation; but if even the Teſticles ſhould be alter'd, ſo that they cou'd not be ſecur'd, 'twould be always more advantageous to defer the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on till the Fluxion be a little moderated. If the Omentum be in the part, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, you make the Ligature in the ſound part, and take off the corrupted: It may be avoided, if the tumor be recent, and preſerv'd in its natural State; if it be ſtrongly faſtned to the Gut, you muſt if poſſible reduce them together, provided there appear no ſign of mortification. Whether it has contracted any tie with the Inteſtine Teſticle, rings of the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, or with the productions which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Spermatic Veſſels: 'Tis alway better to take away ſome of its Subſtance, than of the Subſtance of any of theſe parts, if neceſſity compel you to it. Yet I own, if it ſhould at all adhere to the Sack that contains the Inteſtine, provided it be ſound, 'twou'd be better to hurt the Purſe than Epiploon. But as it cannot remain long in that condition without being alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, we are alway forc'd to cut a great Portion of it: You muſt take care in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Ligature, that you don't ſtraiten
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:110043:51"/>the part too much, becauſe 'tis of a looſe texture, ſpongy, and eaſie to be cut. You paſs the Thread ſeveral times all about ſlightly, ſtraitning it after having paſs'd the Needle through its Subſtance.</p>
               <p>In the Operation of the <hi>Bubonocele,</hi> you make not ſo great an Aperture, but make it according to the extenſion, and bigneſs of the tumor. Concerning the reſt, you follow the ſame Rules, and obſerve the ſame circumſtances formerly mentioned.</p>
               <p>When you have diſcovered the Purſe which makes the <hi>Hernia,</hi> you tear it to pieces dexterouſly with your Nails, or the Fleam, and if inſtead of the Inteſtine you find water, be not ſurpriz'd with the ſuppoſal that you have hurt the Inteſtine, but take Courage, and remember only the ſigns of which we have ſpoken, which will fortifie you, and put you into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſucceſsfully to perform the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for 'tis only the Purſe which is full of waters, in which the inteſtine floats: Theſe waters are furniſhed by the Glands of the internal ſurface of the Peritonaeum; and by thoſe of the Inteſtines, or by the eruption of ſome. Lymphatic Veſſels: Theſe are, if I miſtake not, moſt of the particulars which this Operation contains; after having Embrocated with Oyl of <hi>Roſes,</hi> you muſt apply good defenſitives
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:110043:51"/>over the part and Hypogaſtrick region, with good compreſs moiſtned in <hi>Oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate,</hi> and ſuſtain the applications with the ſimple <hi>Spica;</hi> in all theſe affects, you muſt alway eaſe the Purſes by a Suſpenſorium, and prefer Clyſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other general Medicines.</p>

               <p>To have an Idea of their generation, you muſt conſider that the one attacks the Subſtance it ſelf, and the other its Tunicles, after this you muſt look upon the Spermatic Arteries, as the true ſource and channels which convey the Matter, of which the Carnoſities are form'd, and that the Arterial Blood, furniſhing the Teſticles with the Matter of Seed, to be prepared there, lets ſlip in this Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boration, its moſt greaſie and viſcous part, which the moderate heat that we find there condenſes in the little chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels which compoſe them, or in their Tunicles, almoſt as the white of an Egg hardens over a moderate Fire: This Matter coming to ſwell and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend theſe little tender Pipes, produces that which we call a ſpongy and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinomatous Excreſcence.

This is performed without trouble or danger, but omit not drying up the ſource by the uſe of general Remedies, otherwiſe the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor will not fail to return.</p>
               <p>The ſecond kind of Hydrocele, which generally poſſeſſes only one ſide, ordinarily attacks the Tunicles of the Teſticle. It's alſo much more painful through the great tenſion of its Membranes.</p>

               <p>The cauſe of this Strangulation comes ſometimes from the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the Cutis,<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> which forms a ſort of Bolſter, and ſometimes from Inflamation, which a Shanker or ſome other tumor preceded; if the Strangulation be conſiderable, there muſt needs follow interruption of the courſe of Blood and Spirits in theſe parts, and conſequently a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification: In this affect the Yard-ſwells ſo hard, that it forms three or four Bags, as it were alternately diſpos'd half a Finger's breadth one from another: Theſe purſings come partly from the obſtructions, and partly from the reflux of Blood and Spirits in the Body of the <hi>Virga,</hi> they are commonly follow'd by a tumor which occupies the neck of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:110043:58"/>the prepuce, and which is full of a reddiſh water, which by the great heat of the part ſo rarifies ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that from an Aqueous it becomes Windy.</p>
               <p>This tumor augments ſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably the Inflamation, that if you don't ſcarifie deep the tumified places to give a diſcharge, the Penis wou'd not fail to mortifie.</p>

                  <note place="margin">How to bring over the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puce.</note>You muſt endeavour to reduce the Prepuce without compreſſing the Glans, or putting your Thumb on its extremities, as moſt do that treat of this Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon is, that when the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the Glans is preſſed, it enlarges it ſelf, and ſwells more, which inſtead of making the prepuce ſlip, rather folds up, and hinders its reduction.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Opinion of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning its formation.</note>All the Ancients and their Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have alway maintain'd with great heat, that the Stone is form'd by the moſt Craſs, Courſe, and viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous particles of Blood, which being carried into the Bladder with the Urine, came to be the Matter of the Stone.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of Hypoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.</note>
                  <hi>Hypocrates</hi> imagined, that the Stone was form'd by the Urines retention in the Bladder, and that the moſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:110043:59"/>groſs and terreſtrious Particles ſtop'd there, and ſtuck to the bottom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the ſame manner as the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel gathers in the bottom of a pot, where the Urin has been long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, and that certain ſlimy Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles gather there, which ſerve for a tie to the little Gravels there aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, and that after this manner, by the overgrowing of a new Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Stone becomes inſenſibly bigger.</p>
               <p>This Opinion is more probable than ſolid; for it's evident, if the Stones were form'd after <hi>Hipocrates</hi>'s way, ſuppoſing the principles which he admits, 'twould doubtleſs not have conſiſtence ſtrong enough to reſiſt the Hammer as this doth, it's much more reaſonable to believe, that what we ſee in the Urinal of thoſe thus Diſeas'd, is nothing elſe but the Volatil Spirit of Urin, which taking its flight, ſticks rather to the ſides of the Urinal than bottom, as experience demonſtrates.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Opinion of <hi>Ferneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Fernelius</hi> pretends, that all the Stones which are found in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fall from the Reins by Nephri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical pains, and ſays, That if the Gravel which paſſes from the Reins
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:110043:60"/>into the Bladder, be of any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable bigneſs, and that it lies there for ſome time, the Stone is form'd there, which grows bigger and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by the acceſs of new Matter which comes to it without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: And that which fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to believe, that Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phritick pains excited the Gravel to fall from the Kidneys into the Bladder, was, That he never found any one troubled with the Stone, but ſome Nephritick pain went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>He ſays alſo, That when you break the Stones which are wholly form'd, you find in the middle a little Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, which has a covering different in Colour, and Subſtance from the reſt of the Stone, and whoſe Figure perfectly imitates the Pelvis of the Kidneys, from whence he concludes the Stone is formed in it, before it falls into the Bladder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fernelius</hi> wanted nothing more than the knowledge of the principles of the Stone, to have had a perfect Idea of it: And what made him fall into this Error, after <hi>Hipocrates</hi> was, That he founded himſelf on
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:110043:60"/>that old Maxim of the Ancients, that Stones are formed by the terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial and groſs particles of the Blood, which diſengaging themſelves from the others, and uniting together, form Calcules.</p>
               <p>The only reaſon which they give for it, is, that theſe Gravels are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firm and maſſy, and that ſuch Bodies can't be fram'd, but by the aſſembling of that which is moſt irregular, and heavy in the Blood. They pretend alſo, that we muſt conceive this generation to be like the groſs and maſſy Bodies which are made on the Earth, to which the formation of the Stone in Man's Body has a great deal of Analogy: All Minerals having no other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples than the moſt inflexible and weighty Particles of the Earth: But this is a prejudice grounded only on the impreſſion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd Ideas of the Senſes.</p>
               <p>Reaſon and Experience are their oppoſites, for this latter ſhews, that the Volatile Spirits, and moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bodies frame by their mixture a heavy and ſolid Body; which the ſixt Salts, and other groſſer Bodies,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:110043:61"/>more incapable of motion cannot do, as Chymiſtry Demonſtrates: Nay, Reaſon convinces us of it, for it's eaſily conceiv'd, that the groſſer and more irregular Particles cannot adjuſt, or reſtrain ſo well, or preſs themſelves with ſo much ſtrength, as the more fine and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, in order to the framing a ſolid and compleat Body.</p>

                  <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> diſcovers to us two eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial principles in the Urin, by the Analyſis which it has made of it.</p>
               <p>The one is a Urinous and Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Salt, which much reſembles the Spirit of <hi>Nitre:</hi> And the other a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Aethereal Sulphur, which is like Spirit of Wine.</p>
               <p>Experience Demonſtrates,<note place="margin">Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that if we mix Spirit of Wine with Spirit of Nitre, a coagulum is preſently form'd, but theſe two principles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engaged in the Urine, and it's courſe not permitting them to Unite together to form the Stone.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Van Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont's <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</hi>
                  </note>The Urine, as <hi>Van Helmont</hi> ſays, muſt fall into ſome diſorder before the Stone be form'd, and although the eſſential principles of the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, in which conſiſts the Seed of the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:110043:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>Stone, be in the Urine, it needs an intermedium or ferment to excite and cauſe the Seed to germinate like as in other generations, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis a corruptive ferment, ſays <hi>Van Holmont,</hi> which is ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered in the Urine, and which awakes and vivifies the principles of putrefaction, which uniting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves intimately form the Stone in the midſt of the Kidneys.</p>
               <p>This is the manner this Author proves it, and we may ſay to his Credit, that of all who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on this Subject, none has done better than he.</p>
               <p>He ſays, there's no Tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Principle in Nature without Ferment: The Urine does not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in us, becauſe of its motion; but there muſt needs be found in it a corruptive Ferment, by occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which, 'tis apt for Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; ſo that the Putrefaction is not made by the Urin's being vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, but the Reins Suſcitate the vitious Ferment to the generation of this ſtrange Body: And he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that 'tis the ſmell alone of the principle of Putrefaction which ſtirs
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:110043:62"/>up, and ſeparates in Heterogeneal parts, that which before ſeem'd to be Homogeneal; like as the ſmell of a Veſſel, wherein there has been ſome acidity coagulates and ſowers Milk,<note place="margin">The Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Stone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a ſmell only.</note> or as the ſmell of Leven Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and infects the Dough, and the ſmell of a muſty Fat, corrupts and Ferments the Wine, even ſo in the Urine does the Ferment, which diſpoſes to the Gravel, conſiſt in a pure ſmell only.</p>
               <p>It's alſo obſerv'd, that the Urin putrifies ſooner in a ſtinking Veſſel, in which Urin has been kept a long time, than in one which is clean and new.</p>
               <p>He ſuppoſes, that the coagulation of the Stone is made in an inſtant, though its growth is made by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and ſometimes all at once.</p>
               <p>In the Diſtillation which he has made of the Urin, he has always found therein a Spirit of <hi>Nitre,</hi> which he calls a coagulating Spirit, aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Spirit of Wine, and though they be both very volatil, they coagulate, as Spirit of <hi>Vitriol</hi> mix'd with <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> which eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porates alſo very eaſily.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:110043:62"/>
               <p>Beſides this coagulating Spirit, and the Spirit of Wine which meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Urin, he ſays, there is alſo found in it a terreſtrial Styptick Spirit, which by the means of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction becomes volatil, ſo that this Spirit of Urine, drinking up the terreſtrial Spirit, excited by a putrid Ferment, ſuſcitates the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine which is in repoſe, and concentred in the Urine, which mingling intimately together, and acting one with another, by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal action, condenſes in the middle of the Urine, and forms a ſtony Matter.</p>
               <p>The good or bad uſe of Food, contributes much to its formation; we obſerve, that thoſe who uſe too ſpiritous Drinks, and dirty Food are more ſubject to it than others. We ſee alſo, that thoſe who live on Milk Meats, Fruit, Pulſe, Rye bread, and ſeveral other Impurities, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tormented with it: The latter contribute to it, becauſe of their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, and the other by reaſon of their ſpiritous Particles, the latter fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the principles of the Stone, and the other the Ferment, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes <gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">

               <p>

                  </note>As for Probes, you ought to have ſome great, ſmall, and middle-ſized ones, for all ſorts of Ages; ſtrait and crooked for both Sexes, with <hi>canulas</hi> garniſhed with a ſtillett, to empty the bladder of the urine, and others hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as a Directory to perform the Operation with; you may uſe the Prob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>or <hi>Catheter</hi> divers ways.</p>
               <p>In the firſt, the Chirurgion takes with his left hand the top of the Yard, (dilating its paſſage a little) and pulls it upwards, that the chanel of the <hi>urethra</hi> make a ſtrait line, to facilitate by that means the entry of the <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> into the bladder; all the difficulty conſiſts in introducing it methodically, which is, that the extremity which is held in the hand be outward, and the convexity inward; and as its point
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:110043:69"/>approaches towards the neck of the bladder, you give it half a turn, by which means you make it ſlip under the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> and cauſe it to enter into the hollow of the bladder, ſo that its point is within, and its convexity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Second way of Probing.</note>The ſecond method is much more eaſy, and leſs troubleſom, becauſe you introduce the Probe quite contrary to the former; and without giving it a turn, you make it ſlip into the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>Good Probing is not only neceſſary for extracting the Stone, but alſo in all carnoſities and inflamations of the bladder; it's of great uſe as often as the Urine is ſuppreſt in this paſſages, and very often one periſhes in all thoſe occaſions, for not knowing how to probe well.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the operation methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.</note>To make the Operation, you uſe a hollow Probe, which being in the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Chirurgion muſt bring it to the ſide of the belly, that its convexity may preſs the interior ſurface of the <hi>Perineum,</hi> and make it riſe in a hillock, and whilſt the Servant holds up the Yard, and top of the Probe with his left hand, and the Teſticles with his
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:110043:69"/>right, the Operator, with his thumb and forefinger, faſtens the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent part of the Probe to the right ſide of the <hi>Perineum,</hi> and with a Knife cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on both ſides, he makes an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion all along the hollow, more or leſs great, according as he judges the bulk of the Stone to be. To make the Inciſion regularly, he holds the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument like a Lancet, beginning to pierce the moſt elevated part of the <hi>Perineum</hi> ſtill to the hollow of the Probe, which ſerves to the Knife as a Directory, and without any ſtop paſs and repaſs it ſeveral times over the ſurface of the Probe, till it be quite diſcover'd, leſt you make divers Inciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the bladder. Before you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the <hi>Catheter,</hi> feel with your finger, to know whether there remain any adherence which might hinder the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the Conductor, introduce its extremity into the hollow of the Probe as low as poſſible, the Conductor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were engaged in the Probe, as you withdraw it ſoftly out of the bladder, you puſh your Conductor, and make it follow the motion of the Probe, otherwiſe it might eſcape ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and the Operation would not
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:110043:70"/>ſucceed with the ſucceſs one would deſire; when you'r ſure that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor is in the capacity of the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, you ſlip over its ſurface ſtrait or crooked pincers, then withdraw your Conductor, and ſearch dexterouſly for the Stone on all ſides without violence; then take hold of it; if it's faſtned or ſticks, you turn ſoftly your hand on both ſides to break the ties which hold it, without cauſing Contuſion or Haemorrhagy.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What's to be done when it ſticks to the bladder.</note>If the Stone ſtrongly adhere, you muſt not offend the bladder, but move it moderately; if your ties be too ſtrong, you muſt uſe the toothed crow's-bill or inciſive pincers, always taking care leſt you offend the bladder.</p>
               <p>When the Stone happens to be too big, enlarge the Wound with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and reject the uſe of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latorium,</hi> by reaſon of the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſions it commonly leaves in the parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What's to be done when any urgent Symptoms happen in time of the Operation.</note>If any Accident ſhould happen in the time of the Operation, as Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhagy, Syncope, or any other trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Symptom, the Chyrurgion ought rather to correct them, than finiſh the Operation, and ſo leave the Patient in

               <p>Now it's eaſy to underſtand from all I have ſaid, that the Circulation of the Humours muſt be very ſlow in that part, becauſe they remount againſt their own weight, and are deprived of the motion of the muſcles, which is of great uſe to haſten the Circulation of all the Juices; ſo for any little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion they have to ſtop, and be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted there, (if by chance any of the External Cauſes, which we have ſpoke of, contribute towards it) they never fail; if ſo be it comes from the Veins, to cauſe the Haemorrhoids; Inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Impoſtumations, if from the Arteries; and Excoriations, and Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, if from the Lymphatic Veſſels and Glands. And as theſe parts are extreme penetrable, if the blood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires any malignity or ill quality by its fermentation, nothing hinders but it opens it ſelf a way, and finds paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to attack ſometimes the gut, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the fleſh, ſanguiferous veſſels, nervous parts and bones; and finally, to produce the diverſity of Fiſtula's, which we call ſtrait, oblique, or wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:110043:74"/>When the Fiſtula is in the fleſh,<note place="margin">Signs of Fiſtula's in divers parts.</note> the <hi>Pus</hi> that comes out of it is thick, muddy, courſe and viſcous.</p>
               <p>If it attack the nervous parts, you have pungent and violent pains, and the humour which flows from it is ſharp and ſerous; if the matter of the Fiſtula move towards the ſanguiferous veſſels, and break any of them by its acrimony, its colour is like the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of fleſh; if the Fiſtula penetrate to the bone, and it be altered or rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the matter which comes from it is clear, thin, and in its higheſt degree of acidity.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A ſalt and ſharp juice the cauſe of caloſity.</note>We likewiſe obſerve, that in theſe kind of Fiſtula's, the caloſity is much more conſiderable than in others; for as all the world knows that the caloſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Fiſtula depends only on the preſence and action of a ſharp and ſalt juice-like Brine, you muſt not be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed if thoſe that reach the bones (which are nouriſhed with a humour that's extremely ſalt and pungent of its own nature) be ſo calous; for from the moment that the ſides of an Ulcer care water'd, and humected with an humour like it, if its <hi>intemperies</hi> be not corrected, its points creep inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:110043:75"/>into the bottom of the Ulcer, and after ſeveral punctions, theſe little needles (which we muſt conſider as ſo many wedges) enter, and fix them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo into the poroſities of the fleſh and membranes, that they render the Ulcer ſo hard and calous, that it turns into a Fiſtula.</p>
               <p>As for the Prognoſtics of Fiſtula's,<note place="margin">Prognoſtics.</note> I ſay in general, that thoſe which are new, which happen in a good tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parament of body, are well condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and that poſſeſs ſuch parts where Medicines may be eaſily appli'd, are curable.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary, if they be old, the Party Cachectical, when they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs ſuch parts as are neceſſary for life, as the Bladder and Inteſtines, uncura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Laſtly, all Fiſtula's which attack the Bones, Tendons, Arteries, <hi>Vertebra's</hi> of the Back, Breaſt, Belly, Paps, <hi>Axilla,</hi> Groins and Joints, are doubtleſs diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to overcome.</p>

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:110043:75"/>Accidents. Finally, there are ſome which reduce the parts to ſuch a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing and deplorable condition, that they being unable to perform their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary functions, we are obliged to amputate the parts, as thoſe in the Joints, unleſs it be in the <hi>Axilla,</hi> or other parts where the Operation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perform'd.

               <p>IN the Operation of the Fiſtula <hi>in Ano,</hi> of what kind or nature ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, you always obſerve the ſame Rules and Maxims.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Operation.</note>Firſt, You place the Patient on the brink of a Bed, laying him on his belly, his legs ſtradled; you diſpoſe a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage about his body in ſhape of a T. if it be a Fiſtula that openeth inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you introduce, if poſſible, the Stylet, or Probe, through the paſſage of the Inteſtine, and ſlip all along the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula to the bottom; when you find with your finger the end of the Probe outwardly, make a little carved Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion over it, that the end of the Probe may come out; bend it a little, and cut, not only all that the Probe embraces, but alſo a little under the bottom of the Fiſtula, that the re-union be more eaſy perform'd. If ſo you can't paſs your Probe through the Inteſtine into the Fiſtula, you make the Inciſion
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:110043:77"/>outwardly on the Tumor, as we have preſcrib'd, that the Probe may be eaſier introduced and paſſed into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">When a Cauſtic is to be uſed.</note>If the Tumor be ſomewhat diſtant from the brink of the <hi>Anus,</hi> you muſt prefer a potential Cautery before the Biſtory, for to leſſen the pain.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">When the Operation is to be omttted.</note>If the Fiſtula anticipate the breadth of four Fingers upon the body of the Gut, and that it openeth above the <hi>Levadores Ani,</hi> you muſt not hazard the Operation, for Reaſons which we will alledge hereafter.</p>
               <p>In the Fiſtula which opens outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you paſs a Stilet through your A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perture, and pierce the Inteſtine, and make it come out of the <hi>Anus</hi> to bend it, or make a Handle, as hath been ſaid.</p>
               <p>Some in a Fiſtula make uſe of Sciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, and others of a narrow Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment like a crooked Biſtory, whoſe edge is arm'd with a ſheath of Tin, you introduce it through the orifice of the Fiſtula, and paſſing it through the orifice of the Gut, you cut at one flaſh the whole bottom of the Fiſtula; if the Caloſity be conſiderable, you ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify the ſides and bottom: the moſt
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:110043:78"/>to be fear'd are the Arteries; but if by misfortune you ſhould have cut any of them,<note place="margin">Vitreobe's to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</note> you muſt uſe ſome ſtiptic water, or the ligature if you can, and reject the vitriolate Button, becauſe of the Inteſtine.</p>
               <p>The Operation being made, you introduce your fingers into the Fiſtula, to find if there be any adherence or ſinuſſes, which muſt be looſen'd, and open'd with the Sciſſers, (as well to facilitate the entrance of Medicines, as to give paſſage to the Matter which lurks there, and which would in time ſerve for a new Ferment to produce new Fiſtula's) avoiding always the Arteries, which are felt by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual pulſation.</p>

                  </note>You muſt obſerve that the <hi>Pus</hi> and Blood do not always fall upon the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> by reaſon of the adherence which the Lungs contracts with the <hi>Pleura,</hi> ſo that they can communicate their inflamation and alteration to one another; and that the matter may paſs from the Lungs, through the aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the wound, without one drop of it being ſpill'd in the cavity of the breaſt, which is to be well examined before you ſeparate the Lungs from the <hi>Pleura</hi> with your finger or Probe, (as moſt Practitioners are wont to do) that is to ſay, if the matter run with eaſe through the Aperture, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> being oppreſſed with it, you muſt no ways break the adherence of them.</p>

                  </note>I do not ſpeak here of diſeaſes of the Throat; we know well enough that never an <hi>Empiema</hi> ſucceeded a Quinſy; the reaſon is, that the <hi>Pus</hi> cannot fall upon the ſubſtance of the Lungs, without cauſing a ſudden ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focation, becauſe the <hi>Pus,</hi> by its weight, would hinder the play of the veſſels that compoſe them; wherefore there
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:110043:80"/>is only Pluriſies and Impoſtumes of the Lungs, which precede the <hi>Empiema</hi> that comes from an internal cauſe.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Cauſes of a Pluriſy.</note>As for the eauſe of a Pluriſy, ſome ſay it's form'd by a boiling and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous blood, which is extravaſated in the <hi>Plura;</hi> others pretend it's caus'd by a bilous blood, which gathers and putrefies between the ribs and <hi>Plura.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some others maintain that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from an extravaſation of blood that comes from the intercoſtal veins, and the <hi>Aziges;</hi> which is diſcharged between the duplicature of this mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, where it changeth into <hi>pus</hi> by its ſtay there: though this laſt opinion be not over-well grounded, yet it is the moſt common, and moſt received.</p>
               <p>It were to be wiſh'd that all theſe opinions were as true as they are au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by their Partiſans; for beſides, that the blood being ordinarily ſpilt out of the veſſels only after ſome blow or wound, it's evident that the bilous particles are rather capable to diſſolve a matter than coagulate it, and that it's only the ſalt volatil alkalies of the Bile which tend to the exaltation; but there muſt needs be here a coagulating Agent, which diſpoſeth it to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:110043:80"/>in this membrane. There is nothing more common,<note place="margin">A common Cauſe of Pluriſies.</note> than to ſee in the Summer-ſeaſon Pluriſies affect thoſe, who having over-heated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by running, or ſome other as violent exerciſe, go imprudently to drink Iced. Liquors, or in a Cellar to cool themſelves, having moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Breaſt open. You muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that in the ſame moment the Pores being much dilated, the blood is in an extraordinary agitation, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes abundance of Swetts; this being ſo, it happens that at the ſame time as this cold drink chills, (as it were) the blood in the veſſels, the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the external cold Air ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Swetts, in ſhutting up the pores, and they being quite diſingaged from the reſt of the maſs, ſtop in the duplicature of this membrane where they coagulate the blood, by the means of their urinous volatil Salt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Urine and Swett analogous.</note>Experience teaches us, that there is no liquor in the body has more ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy with the Urine than Swett; we obſerve alſo that it hath the ſame taſte, ſmell, and conſiſtence; we know that the Urine abounds in a urinous volatil Salt, and in a very aetherious Sulphur.</p>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:110043:81"/>the reaſon of it is evident, if we make reflection, that no part of the body is ſo deprived of fleſh as the breaſt, which is the incloſure of the treaſure of life, and which conſequently is ſooner pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by the Air; wherefore thoſe who take care to cover at all times their Breaſt well, are much leſs ſubject to Pluriſies, and many other diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>

               <p>Thoſe kind of Pluriſies which we call Popular, or Epidemical, happen oftner in Countries where the Earth abounds with Nitre and Sulphur; and where the heat is exceſſive, as in Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dional Regions.</p>

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:110043:90"/>muſt make uſe of it, for to deliver the Patient from ſuffocation, and the chiefeſt circumſtance of the Operation is, to chuſe a proper place to facilitate the <hi>exit</hi> of the matter.</p>

               <p>HAving preparel all that muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede ſuch a neceſſary OPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RATION, you place the diſeaſed on a Chair or Bed; he muſt keep his Body very ſtrait, and be held up by Servants, that the Chirurgion may the eaſier take notice of the place where he's to make the Inciſion. In fat People you make it ſomewhat large, that you may not be miſtaken.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Operation.</note>You pinch up the Teguments for to cut them at length, (with a Biſtory) and the <hi>fibres</hi> of the great <hi>Muſculus Dorſalis</hi> croſs; for if they were cut otherwiſe, they would ſtop the Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Pleura,</hi> and ſo hinder the running out of the Matter; you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to inciſe dextrouſly the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal Muſcles: ſome inciſe them at the uppermoſt part of the Rib, to avoid the Veſſels that lie all along its internal lower <hi>Sinus;</hi> but ſeeing the Wounds, which are near the Bones, degeneration often into Fiſtula's,<note place="margin">Caution.</note> it's
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:110043:92"/>more proper to make it in the middle of the Intercoſtal Muſcles.</p>
               <p>When you are come to the <hi>Pleura,</hi> you put your finger there, all along which you ſlip a Biſtory for to Inciſe the <hi>Pleura,</hi> minding to guide well the point of the Inſtrument with the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and penetrate not too deep, leſt you offend the Lungs or <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> which are often faſtned to the <hi>Pleura;</hi> the Aperture being made, you put your finger into the Cavity of the Breaſt, as well to make the Inciſion bigger, as to puſh back the Lungs and <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and to looſe them, if they are faſtned to the <hi>Pleura,</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly where the Operation is made in a place of election, different to that which is practiſed in a place of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, without breaking the Adherences, as we have obſerved in the foregoing Chapter.</p>
               <p>If the Lungs ſtrive to come out at the orifice of the Wound, you muſt puſh them back with a blunt hollow Probe, (for to help the running out of the Matter) or with a Pipe of a thickneſs and length proportionable to the deepneſs of the Wound. Theſe long Pipes are very uſeful in the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſema,</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:110043:92"/>becauſe the Aperture of the Wound being little and deep, it's very difficult, without their help, to give Iſſue to the Matter.</p>
               <p>You muſt not make uſe of a Probe,<note place="margin">Caution.</note> to try whether the <hi>Pleura</hi> be pierced; for in paſſing, it often ſeparates from the Ribs, and there is a <hi>Vacuum</hi> made where ſome Blood is apt to gather, which produces a new Impoſtume.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">More Blood to be drawn at a time than Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note>If it be Blood that comes out of the Aperture, you may draw a ſufficient quantity of it; but if it be <hi>Pus,</hi> leſs, by reaſon it contains more ſpirits, and the Patient is apt to fall into a <hi>Syncope.</hi> After this, you ſtop the Wound with a blunt Tent of Lint, having a large head, and being a little crooked at the end, leſt it offend the Lungs. Moſt commonly we tie a Thread to it, fill the reſt of the Wound with little Doſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of dry Lint, to keep the Tent in, and abſorb the Blood, and lay a Plaiſter on it, with Compreſs and Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin about the Body, with the Scapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which is cut in two at one end, and put croſs, to faſten the Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin the eaſier. When the Patient is dreſſed, you make him keep his Bed with his Head high, as if it
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:110043:93"/>were half ſitting; and you let him reſt, till he finds himſelf oppreſſed with the weight of a new Matter; then take the Dreſſings off, and having made the Matter run out, you puſh the Lungs back with a long Pipe, by whoſe means you facilitate the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Matter that remains in the Breaſt; you continue to dreſs it ſo eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day.</p>
               <p>We obſerve often, that the firſt three or four days Blood comes out, the next days Water, and afterwards <hi>Pus,</hi> that groweth thick by little and little.</p>
               <p>We have obſerved already, that in caſe the <hi>Empiema</hi> ſhould afford much Matter, or Water mixed with <hi>Pus,</hi> you muſt not evacuate it all at once, leſt the Patient ſhould fall in ſome weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Air to be corrected when you dreſs the Patients,</note>You muſt always correct the <hi>Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries</hi> of the Air with fire when you dreſs the Patient, and hinder it from entring too abundantly into the Breaſt, becauſe it thickens and coagulates the matter which is extravaſated there, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it from flowing, and cauſes it to come forth in Clods. If it be Blood, the Serocity ſeparates from it, as after
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:110043:93"/>letting Blood; nevertheleſs, whether the <hi>Pus</hi> or Blood be thick, or mixt with ſome Water, you always uſe (with Prudence) Injections of Barley Water, and <hi>Mel Roſar.</hi> with which you cleanſe the Lungs and Breaſt; you muſt always cauſe the injected Liquor to come out by the help of the finger, or hollow Probe; and if the Lungs ſhould ſtick, you muſt looſe them.</p>
               <p>If in time the Blood ſhould grow too watry, and the Patient be oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the quantity of the <hi>Pus,</hi> you would do well to dreſs him three or four times a day.</p>
               <p>The Matter runs ſometimes for the ſpace of three or four months, and as ſoon as there comes nothing out but what comes from the Wound, you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the generation of fleſh, and cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trize.</p>
               <p>You muſt obſerve, that when the Air works upon the Blood that is in the Breaſt, it coagulates it ſometimes, without changing it into <hi>Pus,</hi> and ſo it comes out in Lumps.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Bitter things not to be uſed in Injecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>You muſt not uſe Injections in the beginning, neither make them with Aloes, or other bitter things, becauſe when the Lungs are open, the Patient

               <p>Often after a wound of a Sword, there comes out of it an abundance of blood, and after three or four days no more appears; in this occaſion you muſt quickly cloſe the Wound, and you have all the reaſon to believe, that there were only ſome little Veſſels broke, which gave ſome blood, and which afterwards were ſtopt by the moſt glutinous particles of the blood; of the reſt (however the thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens) there remains no danger.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIV. <hi>Of the</hi> CANCER.</head>
               <p>I Look upon a <hi>CANCER</hi> as the moſt inflamed and rebellious of all the ſchirrous Tumours; the red part of the Blood as well as the white contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to its formation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Principal Cauſes.</note>When <hi>CANCERS</hi> happen in glandulous parts, there is great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance that the <hi>Lympha</hi> is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cauſe there; if they attack any other part, it's to be preſumed that the Tartarous Particles of the Blood have the greateſt ſhare therein. However it be, I ſay that the concourſe of theſe two Humours is always neceſſary for the production of a <hi>Cancer;</hi> all the difficulty is, well to diſtinguiſh which of thoſe two predominate.<note place="margin">What a <hi>Cancer</hi> is.</note> I ſay a <hi>Cancer</hi> is a round, hard, unequal, livid, and painful Tumour, cauſed by the meeting of abundance of Acids, and of the Tartarous Particles of the Blood, from which proceeds the pain and tention of the Veſſels, which very well repreſent the Claws of a Crab.</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:110043:95"/>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cancers</hi> of the Glandulous Parts most painful.</note>Thoſe <hi>CANCERS</hi> which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the Glandulous Parts, are much more painful than the others, through the abundance of Nerves which enter into their Compoſition; and if the alteration of the <hi>Lympha</hi> contribute any thing to their generation, it's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Glands are its principal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatories.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cauſe of the Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note>The Roundneſs of the Tumour, cometh from the Round Figure of the Glands, becauſe the Humours which cauſe the Obſtruction, and extend the Veſſels, can eaſily tumify theſe Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Bodies, without changing their Conformation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cauſe of the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>As for the Tention, and fulneſs of the Veſſels, it's known that the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they contain, is nothing elſe than the Matter which forms the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. This Humour is Tartarous, fixt, and groſs, and conſequently not very capable of Fermentation; the ſlow progreſs the Tumour makes in the beginning, is a convincing Proof of it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lympha</hi> being acid, it may well excite ſome little Fermentation with a porous and terreſtrial Salt, which the red part of the Blood furniſhes; but it
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:110043:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſerves rather to fix and concenter the Humours yet more than they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>If this Fermentation were capable of cauſing the fulneſs and tention of theſe little Veſſels, it would be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs too ſlow and weak to break them ſo ſoon; the Matter lieth long there quiet, till having been exalted by the Application of ſome Medicines,<note place="margin">How the <hi>Cancer</hi> ulcerates.</note> it gnaws the Veſſels and Veſicles which contain it, then, I ſay, the <hi>Cancer</hi> ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.</p>
               <p>The Veſſels which are puft up in a <hi>Cancer,</hi> are ſo little and tender, that one cannot diſtinguiſh them in their natural ſtate, nor take them for what they are, if one did not ſee them fill'd and extended; the Humour that is within theſe Channels and Veſſicles, not being preſently able to ferment enough to break them, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved, it's at leaſt ſufficient to extend and make them appear.</p>
               <p>You muſt not think that the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the Veſſels are open for the moſt attenuated and ſubtileſt Particles of the Matter to eſcape; I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that in the <hi>Cancer</hi> there's found
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:110043:96"/>any Matter in the <hi>Interſtices</hi> of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, till the Veſſicles beginning to break, that the moſt active and exalted part of this Humour may run out: I ſay, that as ſoon as ſome Particles are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, being they are very corroſive, it's then that the Exulceration of the <hi>Cancer</hi> hapneth; and as it is ſometimes long without Ulceration, I maintain, that during all that time of the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, the Humours are always pent up in the Veſſels, different to other Tumours, whoſe courſe of Humours are very rapid, and their Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion very quick and violent, which cauſeth the Veſſels to break, before one hath perceived the ſwelling of them.</p>
               <p>We obſerve that the Veſſels of the Eyes, which in their natural ſtate are imperceptible, grow manifeſt enough in <hi>Opthalmia.</hi> From what I have ſaid, you may eaſily draw the Differences and Prognoſtics of <hi>Cancers;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Differences of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</hi>
                  </note> there are external, and internal; great, little; ulcerated, and not ulcerated, as in all other Tumours. As for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, they muſt always have an acid Juice from the Lymphatic Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:110043:96"/>whoſe Obſtruction cauſeth the Retention of the <hi>Lympha,</hi> and makes acid an aduſt and terreſtrial Matter from the Arteries and Veins.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cancers</hi> that happen to the Paps,<note place="margin">Prognoſtics.</note> and other glandulous parts, are the moſt dangerous, becauſe it's always more difficult to remedy the diſorders of the <hi>Lympha,</hi> than thoſe of the Blood. Beſides, theſe parts are very ſenſible, and more ſuſceptible of ill impreſſions than others, which you may more ſucceſsfully ſecure from the Symptoms which the <hi>Cancers</hi> may cauſe.</p>
               <p>The Cure of <hi>Cancers</hi> (which one may well call <hi>Opprobrium Medicinae</hi>) is very difficult.<note place="margin">Cure.</note> If ſome <hi>Quacks</hi> boaſt of having ſome infallible Remedies for them, Experience ſoon makes us ſee their Impoſture. <hi>Cancers</hi> are very ſelfdom cured by the uſe of Medicines, Chyrurgery ſometimes ſucceeds better, but is always very dangerous: <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſunt occulti Canceri</hi> (ſaith <hi>HIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POCRATES</hi>) <hi>eos preſtat non cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, curati namque: Citius intereunt,</hi>

If you let it alone, it requireth a conſiderable time for the exaltation of any of its ſulphureous Salts which it contains; but if you ſtir it by ſome fermentative and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating Remedies, from being fixt and immoveable as it was, it becomes very active and penetrating, becauſe the Salt and Sulphur (which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains) exalt themſelves, and take the upper hand; then doth this dead Maſs, which ſeem'd before uncapable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any diſorder, change into a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treolic

               <p>THe <hi>Fiſtula Lachrimalis</hi> is always cauſed by a ſharp and ſalt Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor. If the Matter of the Tears, which run through the lachrimal paſſages, have received any alteration, it may cauſe ſome obſtructions in thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, which terminate at the <hi>Aperture</hi> of the <hi>os lachrimale,</hi> without communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating its alteration to the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts. I will not call this indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition a <hi>Fiſtula,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">When the Operation is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</note> but Obſtruction, which nevertheleſs permits the ſeroſity to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape involuntary; which muſt be well diſtinguiſhed, becauſe the operation is not neceſſary if the lachrimal Bone be no way alter'd; for the Operation conſiſts in nothing elſe but to pierce the Bone, and conſume the Carioſity. We uſe in this occaſion general Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and all Coliriums proper to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſtruct and diſinflame theſe parts.</p>
               <p>If the Matter which cauſes the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction excoriate, and ſlightly ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the nigh parts, one may call it

                  </note> and ſtop the paſſage of the Tears. I will call this the true <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> where the operation is of great importance.</p>
               <p>It happeneth often that the ſame Humor which waters the Eye, runs to the lachrimal <hi>Sac</hi> without producing its effect: The reaſon is, becauſe it beginneth only to enter into its firſt degree of Corruption. But this <hi>Sac</hi> being a production of the interior Membrain of the Noſe, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſpongy and penitrable; the Humor has ſtrength enough to peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate it, and ſo cauſe an inflamation
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:110043:104"/>which ſtops the paſſage of the Tears, which by lying there wax ſour, and afterwards grow ſo ſharp, that they cauſe a <hi>Fiſtulous</hi> Ulcer, or a kind of <hi>Fiſtula</hi> which one might call complete, to diſtinguiſh it from the others.</p>
               <p>The Matter of the Tears is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the cauſe of this <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> as it is the effect of it: It's very often the conſequence of ſome Impoſthume, or even of the inflamation of the lachri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal <hi>Sac,</hi> without this pretended ſero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity contributing any way towards it: It may truly by lying ſtill there, thicken and harden by heat, or it may dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, mixing with ſome other ſtrange Humor, and ſo contribute to its Formation.</p>
               <p>You muſt obſerve, That in this laſt kind of <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> there is always ſome <hi>Pus</hi> in the lachrimal <hi>Sac;</hi> the moſt of them that are troubled with it, preſs every day the fide of their Noſtrils, to ſqueeze out the Matter, ſo they may avoid the pain of the operation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather content to have it as long as they live.</p>

               <p>For this you introduce the Probe to know whether the Bone be diſcovered or carnous; but particularly whether its hole be ſtopt.</p>
               <p>If the exterior Orifice of the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> permit not the entry of the Probe,<note place="margin">Caution.</note> you muſt dilate it with a little prepared Sponge, or make an inciſion with the Biſtory, taking care not to cut the little Bridle, which makes the reunion of the two Eye-lids; which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the Tendon of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biculer Muſcle, that performs the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Ligament: for if by chance it ſhould be cut, the lower Eye-lid would be revers'd, which is an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:110043:105"/>much more troubleſome and deform'd than the firſt.</p>
               <p>When you have made the Inciſion, you fill the wound with dry Lint to obſorb the Blood, and dilate the lips to ſee more eaſily the bottom of it. The Bone being laid bare, you intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a little <hi>Canula</hi> into the hole of the <hi>Os Lachrimale,</hi> and with actual Cauteries of different Figures you pierce the Bone, which is very thin; lightly paſſing the Cauteries over its ſurface to haſten Exfoliation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Carioſity, if any.

                  <note place="margin">True cauſe of its gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note>To explain rightly this generation, we muſt only admit a little more heat and intemperies in the Blood.

               <p>Some of them are white, ſoft, and ſome red; the latter are the leſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent, and eaſieſt cured.

Thoſe that ulcerate, and become concerous, are ſometimes conquered with ſuch Remedies as are employ'd in the Pox.

               <p>But if the Wound be compound, that is, if beſides the exterior parts, the Skull, <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> or the ſubſtance of the Brain it ſelf be offended; the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian and Chyrurgeon ought to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend their Judgments, and recollect, at the ſame time, their Ideas and Knowledge, to prevent the ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of any Accident, whoſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ſymptoms are ſo dangerous, and very often Mortal.</p>
               <p>The Skull may be fractured, the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> prick'd, cut, broken, torn, depreſſed; and the Brain cut, taken away, ſhaked, or filed with ſome extravaſated matter.</p>

                  </note> it contains one only difference, which is to diſtinguiſh well whether there be but one, or both Tables fractured.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Moſt inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to Children.</note>According to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> it happens on the Skulls of Children, that have as yet the Bone very ſoft and tender. This Depreſſion is after the ſame manner, as a bruiſe in a Pewter Pot.</p>
               <p>The other kind of Contuſion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the Continuity. In this the Bones are equal and contiguous. It's a ſingle Fiſſure which always reaches beyond the place where the blow was given. If it be apparent, it's called <hi>Khegma:</hi> If it be inſenſible, it's called <hi>Trikiſmos,</hi> or Capillary Fiſſure.</p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:110043:111"/>
               <p>The Inciſion is of three ſorts,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Inciſion.</hi>

                  <hi>Eccope, Diacope,</hi> and <hi>Apokeparniſmos; Eccope</hi> is a perpendicular Inciſion of the bone, without carrying off the piece, leaving nothing but a mark. <hi>HIPPO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRATES</hi> calls it <hi>Hedra,</hi> the Latins <hi>Veſtigium,</hi> or <hi>Sedes.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>HIPPOCRATES</hi> calls it <hi>Eſphla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> or <hi>Enthlaſis,</hi> depreſſion or fracture with a ſplint; he hath eſtabliſhed three kinds of it, <hi>Ecpieſma, Angiſoma,</hi> and <hi>Camaroſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ecpieſma</hi> in <hi>Greek,</hi> is a depreſſion of the Skull, where the Splints preſs the <hi>Dura Mater. Angiſoma</hi> is a depreſſion where the Splint ſeparates it ſelf, and paſſeth under the ſound bone. <hi>Cama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſis,</hi> or the Vault, is the third kind; this is divided in five ſorts.</p>
               <p>In the firſt, a part of the Bone bends down in breaking, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther turns up. In the ſecond, the Bone boweth downward without any
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:110043:112"/>ſlit; this hapneth only to Children, as I have explain'd heretofore.</p>
               <p>The third is a Depreſſion, where the ſides are forced down, the middle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains bent upwards, as a kind of Vault, leaving ſome hollowneſs under it.</p>
               <p>The fourth riſeth of it ſelf; this is alſo when the Bones are only membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, becauſe they have a kind of ſpring or elaſtic virtue, till they begin to oſſify.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the fifth kind of <hi>Camaroſis</hi> is, when the ſecond Table is depreſs'd, and the outward return'd to its firſt ſtate; this laſt only happens to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, for Reaſons which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Contra Fiſſura</hi> which <hi>HIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POCRATES</hi> hath eſtabliſhed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ground,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>5.</hi> Counter-Fiſſure.</note> hapneth in the ſame Bone, in divers Bones, and in different Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; in the ſame Bone, when the uppermoſt part is ſtruck, and the lower broke in divers Bones, as when the blow is given on the occipital, and the coronal is broke; in different Tables when the firſt is ſtruck, and the ſecond broke.</p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:110043:112"/>
               <p>Theſe are three Chymeric Examples quite contrary to the ſtructure of the part; if we ſee wounds of the head of this nature happen after Concuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the brain, it proceeds not from a Counterfiſſure, (as <hi>HIPPOCRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TES</hi> pretends) but by true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">No ſuch thing as a Counter-Fiſſure.</note>It may eaſily be ſeen, that when a man has loſt his ſenſes, and hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd them partly again, he is yet all giddy, and may after this manner relapſe twice or thrice, and get new Wounds; for it's impoſſible that a Machin compoſed of ſeveral pieces as the Skull is, can break in a place oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to that where it received the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, it being certain that the blow dieth in all the circumference of the aſſemblage, and that the diploe hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the ſhake from being communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the interior Table.</p>
               <p>But without confounding and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking our ſelves, we may ſay, that the Skull may be ſlit, depreſſed, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured, cut, or carried off.</p>
               <p>If it be ſlit, the Fiſſure is viſible, or almoſt inſenſible; but whether it be apparent or not, nothing is capable
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:110043:113"/>of giving us convincing marks that it penetrates, and that there is blood ſpilt on the <hi>dura mater,</hi> than theſe which ſucceed.</p>
               <p>The uſe of Ink, the Rugine, and the Handkerchief in the mouth keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one's breath, is abſolutely uſeleſs, becauſe the Diploe confounds and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders one from ſeeing whether it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the <hi>dura mater,</hi> or not; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the practice of the Rugine will never be approved on by good Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitioners, not only becauſe they do not give us any knowledge, but alſo becauſe there remains a loſs of ſubſtance, and deformity of the part.</p>
               <p>If it be Depreſſion, it preſſes with it the <hi>dura mater,</hi> and cauſeth ſeveral Accidents, which we will examine.</p>
               <p>If it be fractured, either the Splin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are ſeparated from the <hi>Cranium,</hi> or not; ſo by either way the <hi>dura mater</hi> may be compreſs'd, prick'd or torn, and the Brain hurt, or at leaſt ſome Blood may be ſpill'd upon theſe parts.</p>
               <p>In all theſe occaſions, (I ſay) if the Fracture do not permit an unition of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:110043:113"/>the ſhatter'd Bones, and vent given to the ſtrange bodies, which might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>dura mater,</hi> you muſt, without more ado, perform the Operation, (provided ſome ill Symptoms prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) otherwiſe the Patient would die.</p>
               <p>If it be cut or carried off either with, or without ſhattering the Bone; as for example, If the Inciſion pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate not, and there be only a part of the Bone ſeparated, the conſequences are not dangerous; but if it go deep, and there be ſome Splints ſeparated that offend the <hi>dura mater,</hi> if we do not ſoon remedy it, the Patient is in danger of life.</p>

                  </note>If the <hi>dura mater</hi> be inflamed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by diffuſed blood, or by ſome pricking, compreſſion, tention, cut, or rupture, one preſently feels pain and heavineſs in that part, the Eyes grow puft up and inflamed, the Face red and ſwell'd, the diſeaſed is drowſy with Fever, the Pulſe hard with ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings, and blood comes often from the noſe, ears and mouth, juſt as in great concuſſions of the brain.</p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:110043:114"/>
               <p>We know that the <hi>dura mater</hi> is prick'd or torn, when there are ſome ſharp pointed Splints, or rugged pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the bone which preſs it.</p>
               <p>We are perſuaded that it's compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when the bones are depreſs'd and appli'd, as it were, againſt its ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, or that the broken pieces of bones are ſeparated; or finally, that there is ſome extravaſated blood which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends it.</p>
               <p>We are convinc'd that it's cut, when it's caus'd by a ſharp and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Inſtrument, and that the Fracture be of a great length; but if the bone be only crackt, and ſome blood be extravaſated upon the <hi>dura mater,</hi> only thoſe ſigns which I have deſcrib'd, (and which I am going to explain) can give us certain evidences of it; I need not here repeat the explication of the pain.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXII.</hi> Of the Operation of the <hi>Trepan.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BEfore we give a Deſcription of the Operation, it's important to examine all the Circumſtances ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to render the <hi>Operation</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful. It conſiſts in Piercing the Skull, and to make an Aperture near the Fractured part. To execute theſe two Intentions, it's neceſſary to know whether all the parts of the Head can endure the <hi>Trepan;</hi> I ſpeak not here of the Bones which are moſt eaſie to break, thoſe that know the Aſteology are inſtructed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>If the Fiſſure be ſimple, apply your Trepan juſt near the Cleft, if it be very little, one might Trepan upon the Fiſſure it ſelf, to give an eaſier vent to the Matter, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs with this Circumſtance,<note place="margin">A Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be obſerved in Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paning.</note> which is to Anticipate a little upon the ſide that hath the moſt ſtrength; which muſt be obſerved in all other places of the Skull.</p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:110043:127"/>
               <p>If you ſhould meet with any ſtrange body, that were forced down into the body of the Bone, ſo that it could not be pulled out, you muſt apply the Crown of the Trepan upon the ſtrange Body to carry off the Piece.</p>
               <p>If it be a conſiderable Fracture, where a part is forced down, you Trepan upon that part where you think moſt convenient to elevate the Bone, nevertheleſs you muſt apply the Trepan upon a part that's firm enough to ſuſtain it without breaking it down. If the firſt Aperture be not ſufficient to lift up all Pieces, you muſt make a ſecond and a third if it be neceſſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">We muſt not Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan the Sutures.</note>We never Trepan upon the Sutures, eſpecially upon that place call'd <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanella,</hi> leſt we break the Veſſels which paſs a croſs, and tear the <hi>Dura mater</hi> which adheres to the Skull, eſpecially in its windings, ſo that the Blood which is extravaſated on one ſide, hath no communication with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Wherefore if the Fracture ſhould croſs a Suture, and anticipate upon two Bones, you muſt Trepan upon both ſides.</p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:110043:127"/>
               <p>Trepaning is alſo forbidden di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly in the mid'ſt of the Coronal and Occipital Bone, eſpecially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Inferior part, by reaſon of their Spina's where the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Dura mater</hi> are faſtned, which are let in.</p>
               <p>We Trepan not upon the Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinal Sinues leſt the ſuppuration ſhould open them, which would cauſe a dangerous Hemorrhagy.</p>
               <p>Neither muſt we Trepan upon the Eyebrows, becauſe of the <hi>Sinus Frontalis,</hi> and of their Cavities, which are lin'd with a conſiderable thick Membrane, deckt with an infinite number of Glands, which ſeparate a Viſcous Humour that actually fills theſe Cavities, which makes that the Wounds of theſe parts do long ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purate. Behold theſe are all the caſes or places of the Skull where the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan is to be rejected, you may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe it in all other parts. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients made a difficulty to Trepan at its inferior part, becauſe of the weight of the Brain, and the propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it has to get out, but it's a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Error, being the ſituation may remedy this diſorder. When
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:110043:128"/>ever you put the Operation in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, this muſt be obſerved, <hi>viz.</hi> That the place where the Trepan hath been applied, muſt always be elevated or the higheſt.</p>

It's there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fitter to imitate their Rectitude, and to make if ſomewhat large to have the liberty of placing the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan, in dilating the lips of the Wound; Others recommend to make it every where elſe in form of a Croſs, but if the Longitudinal Inciſion, or in form of the Letter T, ſuffice to diſcover the Fracture, and place the Trepan, you muſt abſolutely reject that of the Croſs; If the Wound be on the Forehead, you muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Wrinkles of it.</p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:110043:128"/>

                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cranium</hi> covers not the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Muſcle as has been thought.</note>As to what concerns the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Muſcle, it hath hitherto been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that its Wounds are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, being covered with the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cranium,</hi> but it's known that this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane exactly covers the Temporal Bone, even as in all other places of the Skull; and that the part which has been taken for the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> is a lengthening of the <hi>Aponevroſis</hi> of the Frontal and Occipital Muſcles, which frame by their re-union a kind of Tendonous Cover which antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates upon the greateſt part of that Muſcle, and which being prickt or rumpled with ſome blow, cauſeth the ſame accidents which accompany Wounds of the other Tendons; Of the reſt the Wounds of this Muſcle are no more to be feared than thoſe of another. I paſs to the Circumſtances of the Operation.</p>
               <p>Let's now ſuppoſe a Wound at the Superior part of the Parietal Bone. You muſt firſt probe it; If you find the Skull diſcovered, and the Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture not big enough, you dilate it even to the Bone to examine the Fracture, and you fill the Wound with dry Lint, to abſorb the Blood,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:110043:129"/>which might hinder the fight whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be of danger. If any Artery ſhould bleed much, you would be forc'd to make a Ligature, and leave the Wound till next day.</p>
               <p>If the Fracture be conſiderable, and ſome ſplints of the Bone forc'd down, ſo that you were obliged to elevate them, it's the part of a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Surgeon to leave the Dreſſings for 5 or 6 hours till the Hemorrhagy be a little ſtop'd, and then he may chooſe a fit place to apply the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How to uſe the Trepan.</note>When you have fixt on a place, you ſtop the Patients Ears with Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, lay his Head on ſome firm place, ſcrape the <hi>Pericranium</hi> off, leſt you tear it with the Teeth of the Saw, you cover the lips of the Wound, then you chooſe a Crown of a Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan proportionable to the hole you intend to make, but firſt you make a little hole with the Perforative Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan, to faſten the Pyramid which you put into the Crown; afterwards you turn the Trepan, and ſaw the Skull, and when the Trepan hath taken ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hold, you take the Pyramid off, leſt you hurt the <hi>Dura mater,</hi>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:110043:129"/>then you go on ſawing the Skull, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing care from time to time to cleanſe the Teeth, and the hole you have made, and obſerve whether you ſaw equally, ſo you finiſh to pierce the Scull by ſeveral turns; if you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the Crown penetrates more in one place than another, you lean more on that ſide which is not ſo much penetrated to equalize the Aperture.</p>
               <p>You know that you are come to the <hi>Diploe</hi> when the Teeth of the Trepan are Bloody, and ſeeing the Interior Table of the Scull is much thinner than the Exterior, and often adherent to the <hi>Dura mater,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in young People, if you ſhould not take care to turn the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan ſoftly, and to ſhake the Piece at every turn of the Saw, you would be in danger to hurt the <hi>Dura mater;</hi> When the Piece is diſengaged, you take it off with the Piercer or Myrtle Leaf, and you ſcrape the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Aperture with the Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicular Inſtrument, with which you preſs a little the <hi>Dura mater,</hi> to faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate the Iſſue of the Extravaſated Blood, and to introduce more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:110043:130"/>the neceſſary Inſtruments, as the Levatory to elevate the Pieces that were depreſſed.</p>
               <p>If the Piece be extreamly adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the <hi>Dura mater,</hi> you ſeparate it with the Myrtle Leaf: Several Practitioners recommend to let it alone till its fall be procured by Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration; But ſince theſe ties are only in young People, who have theſe parts always moiſt and relaxt, they may be eaſily ſeparated with the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula without any violence.</p>
               <p>When the Piece is taking off, we ordinarily give vent to the Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated Blood upon the <hi>Dura mater</hi> in bidding the Patient ſhut his Mouth and Noſe, and keep his Breath.</p>
               <p>This ingenious manner of preſſing out the Blood, is an effect of the Expanſion of the Lungs, and level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the <hi>Diaphragm,</hi> which preſſes the Deſcending <hi>Aorta</hi> that paſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween its Tendons, and forces the Blood to flow into the Aſcending <hi>Aorta,</hi> and ſo mount to the Head by the <hi>Vertebral</hi> and <hi>Carotid</hi> Arteries with ſuch rapidity, that the Brain riſeth with ſo much ſtrength as to oblige the Extravaſated Blood to flow
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:110043:130"/>through the Aperture of the Skull, or to appear at the Paſſage ſo that it may be abſorb'd with eaſe.</p>

                  </note>Having diſingag'd the <hi>Dura mater</hi> of the Burthen which oppreſſed it, you you wet a little piece of fine Linnen in <hi>Mel Roſar</hi> with <hi>Spirit.

               <p>If the Splints be ſeparated you take them away, if they ſtick to the Skull and cannot be replaced, you cut them off with the Inciſive Pincers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dura mater</hi> is ſometimes ſo inflamed, that it riſes beyond the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perture of the Skull in ſpight of all the precautions that one can take, and ſeeing it's dangerous to Trepan too much, nothing but Bleeding, Clyſters, and an exact Dyet can ſtop the progreſs of the Inflammation.</p>
               <p>If Blood or Matter be got between the Membranes, there's no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy than to give vent to the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. To execute which deſign with prudence you arm a Lancet,<note place="margin">How to penetrate the <hi>Dura mater.</hi>

                  </note>The Signs of the true <hi>Anevriſma</hi> are ſenſible pulſation of the Tumour, and its ſoftneſs, when it's preſſed with the Fingers it diſappears at the ſame time, but as ſoon as you give over preſſing, it comes again into its firſt ſtate. The colour of the Skin is not changed; becauſe the Blood which maintains the Tumour keeps its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidneſs, by the meeting and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of new Blood whoſe motion is
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:110043:134"/>continual. In its leaſt increaſe or bigneſs, it's commonly as big as a Nut, or Egg at moſt; ſome Authors aſſure us, that theſe Tumours aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſometimes ſo much that they break, nevertheleſs we know that ſome have kept them all their lives; and that in moſt Perſons who are troubled with them, the part of the weaken'd Artery becomes ſo hard and callous, that it reſiſts all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts one can make.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Cauſe of Indura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Artery.</note>Though this Oſſification of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery ſeem very difficult to explain, one may nevertheleſs believe, that the ſaline, pungent, and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted particles of the Blood, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the leſſer poroſites of the Fibres of its Tunicle, and they poſt and mingle themſelves with the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juice of the Artery, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute towards its Oſſification.</p>
               <p>But the reaſon which to me ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth moſt evident, and beſt ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is, that the Blood which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the <hi>Anovriſm,</hi> and which is in a continual fermentation, muſt by its motion increaſe the heat of the part which inſenſibly dryeth and hardens the Fibres of the dilated part in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipating
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:110043:134"/>and rarefying the humidity which waters and makes them dull: That which fortifies more this thought, is, that the <hi>Aorta</hi> groweth bony (ſometimes in old People) at its exit from the left Ventricle of the Heart, either through the little heat that's left there, dries it, or becauſe their Blood hath loſt its Viſcoſity which is neceſſary to preſerve its ſpring: Notwithſtanding Experience ſhews us, that it's Oſſified in ſome Perſons.</p>

                  </note>The Signs of the Falſe <hi>Anevriſm</hi> are oppoſite to thoſe of the True; In the Falſe the Pulſation of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is very deep; the Skin almoſt livid, the Tumour is not ſo high, nor round as in the true one, but it takes up more room, it giveth not way ſo eaſily in touching as the true one. The moſt convincing ſigns of the Arteries being opened, is, when the Blood comes out impetuouſly and by jumps, which convinces us, that its motion is continual and unequal.</p>
               <p>This inequality of the courſe of the Blood proceeds from two contrary motions; the firſt depends on the ſtrong conſtriction of the Ventricles
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:110043:135"/>of the Heart, and the ſecond from the ſpring of the Arteries. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Impulſion of the one is much ſtronger than that of the other, it happens, that as the Heart driveth the Blood vigorouſly forward in the time of the Syſtole, the Arteries by their Elaſtic Virtue beat and drive it back weekly in the Diaſtole, which proves the irregularity and continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its motion.</p>

               <p>This Compreſs produceth very good effects; for beſides that it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates the rapid ſtream of the Blood, and by this means you may avoid tying the band too tite, it helps alſo the reunion of the Artery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Impulſion of the Blood being only weak, the Aperture ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates very little.

The firſt is by the Vitriol Button, but the worſt is, that as the Vitriolic particles melt, they ſpread themſelves upon the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments, and adjacent Tendons, which they carry off, rend, and cauteriſe, till at laſt the Patient is lamed, being the part groweth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of its ordinary motions.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is to diſgorge the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour before you make the Ligature of the Veſſel, but behold, as I think,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the ſureſt method.</p>
               <p>The Patient being plac't.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> you lay on the midſt of the Arm a ſtrong Compreſs, ſuſtained with a Ligature
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:110043:137"/>through which you paſs the Tourni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, making ſeveral turns, by which means you benum the Arm, ſtopping the paſſage of the Blood and Spirits.</p>
               <p>The Surgeon Inciſeth with a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet the Tumour following the length of the Artery, which muſt be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Nerve, to have the liberty of tying the Artery half a Fingers breadth above the Aperture with a little ſtrong wax't Thread.</p>
               <p>You muſt obſerve, that in a true <hi>Anevriſm</hi> the Tumour regulates the place where you muſt make the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature, whereas in the falſe we are obliged to looſe the Turniket to know poſitively whence the Blood comes, which is the moſt important circumſtance of the Operation, for to ſtay the Blood, and to avoid mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ligature upon the Aperture of the Veſſel, inſtead of making it a little higher, becauſe the Blood by its impulſion would not fail to dilate the weaken'd part, and to bleed afreſh. For this purpoſe you paſs a Needle over the pipe of the Artery, make firſt a ſingle knot, on which you place a little Compreſs which you faſten with two other knots.</p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:110043:137"/>
               <p>Moſt make another knot in the lower part of the Artery, becauſe of the Branches of communication, and ſince it being a precaution not to be deſpiſed, one may uſe it.</p>
               <p>The Ligature being made, you looſe the Tourniket: If the Blood be well ſtopt, you open the Tumour to empty the Blood, and fill it with Dorſels arm'd with Aſtringent Powders, as <hi>Vitriol. alb.</hi> to conſume the Bag more eaſily you cover the reſt of the wound with Boulſters, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a Plaiſter, Embrocation of <hi>Ol.

               <p>Some time afterwards you muſt Bleed the Patient, if his ſtrength permit, you ſtay two or three days without taking off the Dreſſings, and you leave the Doſſels at the bottom of the Sac 3 or 4 days longer, leſt in taking them out you bleed afreſh, and procure a freſh ſuppuration.</p>
               <p>The ſituation of the Arm, which ſeems a thing of little conſequence, muſt nevertheleſs be regarded as very advantageous for furthering the cure.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:110043:138"/>The Arm muſt be a little bended, and the Hand elevated on the Pillow, that the circulation be more free: But you muſt particularly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Diſeaſed to bow and ſtretch it from time to time. We daily ſee that ſeveral become lame for not having moved the Arm or Leg dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Indiſpoſitions. The cauſe of this accident comes from the little motion of the ſlimy matter which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daubs the Joints: This Slime is of the conſiſtence of the White of an Egg, and which tranſpires from the Ligaments and Glands of the Joynts, ſerving to entertain the ſupple Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments, and to ſmooth the ſhining Cartilages, as well to facilitate the motion, as to hinder the parts from being waſted by their continual at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, but from the moment that this Matter is at reſt, and no more fluid or liquid by the diverſities of motion, it groweth thick and hard by the heat of the part; ſo that the Ligaments and Cartilages being no more humected by that Liquor, they dry up, looſe their Elaſtic Virtue and Humidity, till at laſt they grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of motion.</p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:110043:138"/>
               <p>Sometimes it happens in old Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs and Fiſtula's of the Joynts, that the Purulent and Malign Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters gnaw the Ligaments and Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, and gives occaſion to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Juice, which exuds from the body Fibres, to unite the extremity of the two Bones, and frame a kind of Anchiloſe, which is much more defectuous than the precedent.</p>

               <p>SEveral Authors have treated of the <hi>Gangrene,</hi> particularly <hi>Willis, Etmuller,</hi> and <hi>Silvius;</hi> and I believe no body doubts, but that all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our new Diſcoverers have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced upon this Subject in their Exerciſes, is nothing but a perpetual pillage of what theſe great Men had ſpoken. To ſpeak of it methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, we muſt firſt give an Idea of the Vivification of the parts, and of the Mortification, which is its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:110043:139"/>we muſt relate all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars which cauſe a Gangrene, and ſeek all the means to illuminate them with Reaſons grounded on the Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy of the Blood, and upon ſome Obſervations which Experience Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cauſe of Vivifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>To know how the parts are Vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, you muſt conſider that the heat and life of Animals conſiſts only in the motion and fermentation of the principles of the Blood, that this Fermentation and Motion, as well Circular as Inteſtine, are entertain'd by the pulſation of the Heart and Arteries, by the motion of the Muſcles, and action of the ſubtil and penetrating particles of the Air which we breath.</p>
               <p>It is in effect the ſpiral and nitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous particles of the Air which atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate and ſubtilize the particles of the Blood in mingling themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately together in the ſubſtance of the Lungs, which make them wave upon their centre, and which give them all their vivacity and influence which is neceſſary to the maintaining of their inteſtine motion, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of their heat and Life.</p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:110043:139"/>
               <p>It's certain then, that it's the Blood agitated by theſe means, which vivify and animate the parts, repairs the continual loſſes which they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, furniſhes the matter of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and of all the different Liquors that are ſubtilized in paſſing through a 1000 different Strainers: In one word, it's the Maſter ſpring that makes the whole Machine go.</p>
               <p>This being ſo, it's not hard to conceive that it is from the actual diſtribution, preſence, and action of the ſpirituous, and nouriſhing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Blood, in a part, on which entirely depend its motion and life;<note place="margin">Cauſe of Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> ſo that this diſpenſation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ceaſe, or be interrupted for ſome moments, one feels no more there, either heat, motion, or life. To convince our ſelves of it, we muſt only examine that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens every day in Syncop's, where we ſee that the pulſation of the Heart being hindred, and the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Blood ſtopt, all the Extremities grow cold, the Face pale, and ſometimes lived, and the whole Body deprived of feeling and motion; but according as the Heart recovers
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:110043:140"/>its motion, and the Blood conveyed into all the parts, they recover their heat, motion, and life. It's there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore evident, that the life of a part depends on the preſence and motion of the Blood; and on the contrary I ſay, that the cauſe of a Gangrene and Mortification of a part is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the abſence and want of theſe ſpirituous and nutritive particles in the ſame part. This is the Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the Illuſtrious <hi>Etmuller</hi> gives of it in <hi>Tome</hi> 1. <hi>operum, pag.</hi> 587. where he ſays, <hi>Cauſae Gangren, &amp; ſphaceli in genere ſunt &amp; quae qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumque ratione ſanguinis, &amp; ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum vitalium diſtributionem inhibere valent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a queſtion whether the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits which run from the Brain through the Nerves, are not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe intereſſed in a Gangrene. I ſay, that the moſt cauſes which work upon the Blood for the production of a Gangrene, may in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner work upon the Animal Spirits; but in the mean time the Gangrene only depends on the alteration which happens unto the Blood. This is proved becauſe a Gangrene is a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:110043:140"/>of Life, or at leaſt a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion next to a Mortification; now the Functions of Life depend chiefly from the Blood, whereas the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Functions depend on the Animal Spirits. The Nerves may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, and the Animal Functions ceaſe in a part without Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as is ſeen in Paralytics. It's true then to conclude that a Gangrene depends only on the default of the vital and ſpiritual particles of the Blood.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that will have the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to have much ſhare in the Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, as well becauſe a mortified part is deprived of motion and feeling, as becauſe a great pain cauſeth an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, and ſometimes Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, do not conſider that the weight of the courſer particles of the Blood, which lies in a part, preſſes the Nerves, and ſo interrupts the courſe of the Spirits, and the pulſation of the Artery is no more felt; for as Nature delights to glue the Arteries to the Nerves,<note place="margin">Arteries for the moſt part joyn'd with Nerves.</note> and that ſhe makes uſe of the pulſation to oblige all the little Nervous Fibres to diſcharge the Spirits which they
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:110043:141"/>contain, ſo it will be always true to ſay, that the Gangrene ſucceeds great pains and inflammations, and that the privation of motion and feeling come chiefly from the Blood; ſince it's that which hinders by it's ſtay the diſtribution of the Spirits. I deny not that the want of Animal Spirits in Paralytics may give occaſion to a Gangrene to ſeiſe the ſooner on a part, as we ſhall ſee in the following Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>After all I have ſaid, it's eaſie to comprehend that the heat and life are preciſely contain'd in the Blood, ſince the diſſipation and abſence of it's ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous and nouriſhing particles cauſe the Gangrene, and that their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and exaltation entertain the natural heat.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">True and only cauſe of a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene.</note>I ſay then in general, that the cauſe of a Gangrene and Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the diſſipation &amp; abſence or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centration of the ſpirituous particles of the Blood, which muſt vivify the part, or at leaſt the interruption of the courſe of the ſame, and it's coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation. Theſe cauſes act for the moſt part ſeparately, it may alſo happen that they act together to
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:110043:141"/>cauſe a Gangrene, as I ſhall make you obſerve.</p>
               <p>Let us examine all theſe Cauſes, and firſt ſee what is this alteration of the Blood, that is deprived of its ſpirituous particles, from which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Gangrene and Mortification.</p>
               <p>To give a juſt Idea of it, let's conſider the changes that happen to Wine. All the World agrees,<note place="margin">A Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon.</note> that the good condition of Wine conſiſts in the exaltation of its moſt ſubtil and ſpirituous principles, as long as theſe principles have the upper hand, the Wine remains in a ſtate of gentle and natural fermentation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of goodneſs.</p>
               <p>But if it happen by what cauſe ſoever, that they be weaken'd and diſſipated, and the acid ſalts, or ſalt ſulphurs take the upper-hand; then it is that the Wine grows ſower, and at leaſt ſharp and very diſagreeable. It happens alſo very often, that after the loſs and diſſipation of the ſpirits, there remains nothing in the Wine but Earth and Phlegm; it's without taſte, and is nothing but a dead Maſs and barren Liquor, which in <hi>Latin</hi> is call'd <hi>Vappa, Vinum pendulum,</hi> which
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:110043:142"/>is as it were the Cadaver of the Wine. Finally, it happens, that in cold Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſpirits of the Wine concentre in the midſt of the Veſſel which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it, ſo that all the parts in the circumference being deprived of the ſpirits congeal. I ſay, that when the ſpirituous particles of the Blood are diſſipated, or concentred, it receives almoſt the ſame alteration. If the acid ſalt, or ſalt ſulphurs take the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand, it becometh acid or rank. <hi>Willis</hi> uſes the ſame Example when he explains the alterations that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the Blood,<note place="margin">In tract. de ferm. p. <hi>68.</hi>
                  </note> in compariſon to thoſe that happen to Wine. <hi>Cum a longa fermentatione ſpiritus abſumi, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandum deficere incipiunt, inducitur de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionis ſtatus, quo vina aliique Liquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, ant in vappam tranſeunt, ant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum ſale vel ſulphure nimium exaltatis, acetoſi ant rancidi fiunt, pariter &amp; ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis dum in vaſis circulatur, juxta tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicem hujuſmodi Diatheſin conſiderari poteſt, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, when all the ſpirits are diſſipated, that the Blood degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth into a dead inſpir'd maſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of any fermentation; and whenever the Spirits are concentred
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:110043:142"/>in great cold, they abandon or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the exterior parts, which are then only irrigated with Blood de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of vital and ſpirituous par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. This laſt ſtate of the Blood anſwers to turn'd Wine, whence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the mortification of a part in certain caſes which I am going to propoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cauſe of Gangrene in old People.</note>Firſt, we obſerve, that old People dye very often of Gangrenes, and that that it begins by the Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and follows through the whole Body in ſpight of all Remedies that may be uſed. The ſame thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens through long abſtinence, and after all ſorts of too great evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>To give an account of this <hi>Pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi> you muſt obſerve, that the Blood can, no more than other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors that ferment, always remain in the ſame condition. It's active principles are yet intangled in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, they get looſe in our youth, remain in a ſtate of exaltation dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a certain age; but at laſt they are diſſipated, and begin to abandon their ſubject in old age; therefore old People become by little and little
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:110043:143"/>incapable of their ordinary motions, they looſe inſenſibly their vigour, till at laſt their life, in looſing their heat and ſpirits.</p>
               <p>This being ſo, it's not hard to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain why old People who dye after this manner are always troubled with Gangrenes in their laſt days, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is becauſe their Blood becomes a Languid Maſs, which no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains any character of life, and which in effect is no more than a Cadaver of Blood; This kind of death one may call natural, becauſe it happens not but when the heat is extinguiſhed of it ſelf, and by degrees. <hi>Ideoque mori ſimul dicuntur, &amp; extingui.</hi> In this manner it is that a Mortification of the Blood and Spirits happen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an Hectick Fever, long Fluxes, great Abſtinences, too great Labour, and generally after all ſorts of great Evacuations becauſe in theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the Matter deſigned for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining of natural heat, is diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, or is not enough furniſhed to ſupply the loſs of it which it actually ſuffers.</p>
               <p>Of the reſt, though in this ſtate of the Blood the Gangrene be almoſt
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:110043:143"/>univerſal, and need no other cauſe to manifeſt it ſelf, yet ſometimes it happens, that the ſlowneſs of the circulation gives it occaſion to attack certain parts, there is a very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſe of it in the 46th Chapter of the Second Book of <hi>TULPIUS his Obſervations.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Where he relates, that an old Man was reduced to ſuch a languiſhing condition, and ſo great a weakneſs, that the leaſt impreſſion cauſed him to have a Gangrene, he dared not ſo much as ſit down, nor lean on an Elbow, nor even ſet a Foot on the Ground, or preſs any of his Members, but there appeared ſome marks of Mortification which followed the Gangrene. This Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is rare and ſingular: We muſt confeſs that his Blood was migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily exhauſted of ſpirits, ſince a ſlight compreſſion only was capable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Gangrene in a part.</p>
               <p>We need not ſearch any where elſe for the cauſe of a Gangrene which happens to the Legs and other parts of Hydropics, what I have ſaid explains it ſufficiently, beſides we well enough conceive that the ſerous Blood is deprived of ſpirits, that it
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:110043:144"/>moves more ſlowly in the Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties than any where elſe, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the heat muſt rather be leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen'd in theſe parts than in others, as I have made you obſerve when I ſpoke of the Dropſie, beſides the feroſity filters in ſo great a quantity between the Fibres and the parts, that it may by its weight preſs the Veſſels, and ſo cauſe a Gangrene.</p>
               <p>Secondly, great Cold cauſeth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Gangrene and Mortification in the Extremities, eſpecially the Feet, Hands, Ears, and Noſe, particularly in Perſons obliged to march in the Snow during exceſſive rigours of Winters, as thoſe which Travel in the Northern Regions.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How Cold cauſes a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene.</note>To explain this <hi>Phenomena,</hi> you muſt only remember what I have ſaid in the compariſon of Wine, where we have ſeen that the ſpirits of Wine are concentred by the cold, and that the exterior parts finding themſelves deprived of ſpirits, freeze. This happens to a Bottle of Wine expoſed to a very cold Air: You may obſerve in breaking the Bottle, that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits have retired to the center, and preſerved their fluidity while all the reſt is congealed.</p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:110043:144"/>
               <p>I ſay that the ſame thing happens in the Blood by the rigour of cold, and while the ſpirits retire to the center of the Animal, the exterior parts remain gangrenated, being only irrigated with a dead and inſipid Phlegme, which congeals in the very ſubſtance of the parts.</p>
               <p>It's eaſie to comprehend, that at the ſame time the parts feel the pinches of the cold, they retire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compreſs'd by the action of the Air, which firſt cauſes thoſe quick and penetrating pains, and hinders the Blood from continuing its motion in thoſe parts, therefore lying there ſtill, it inſenſibly ſtops every paſſage, and cauſes an entire mortification. <hi>Hinc Interdum</hi> (ſaith <hi>ETTMULLER</hi>) <hi>ex frigore extrinſecus Irruente partes Gangrenoſae fiunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So much for what regards all kinds of Gangrenes that depend on the diſſipation and concentration of the ſpirits,<note place="margin">Tumors, Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, Luxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. may cauſe a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene.</note> now I come to thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the interruption of the courſe of the Blood, and its motion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Tumours, Fractures, and Luxations, may cauſe a Gangrene in a part, by compreſſing too hard the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:110043:145"/>Veſſels that convey the Blood there; I confeſs that this kind of Gangrene is rare, becauſe the Veſſels commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate themſelves in ſo many places, and there coming ſo great quantity of different branches from them, that it's difficult that all the ſupply of Blood ſhould be hindred in a member.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs <hi>Fabritius Hildanus</hi> aſſures us,<note place="margin">Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that he hath ſeen a Man who was attack'd with a Gangrene in both Legs, and his Feet were always cold and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num'd; ſo he died without a Fever, &amp; without any other ſymptomes: His Body being opened, there was found a ſchirrous Tumour in the Region of his Reins, over the diviſion of his <hi>Iliac</hi> Branches. This Tumor preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed firſt ſlightly the Veſſels, and cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cold and benumming of the Legs, but as it grew, it preſs'd the Artery and Vein ſo hard, that the Blood could no more deſcend into the inferior parts to vivifie them. Concerning Fractures of Diſloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it may happen that the head of a Bone or ſome pieces may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Veſſels ſo hard, as to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the paſſage of the Blood; for the ſame reaſon Bandages,<note place="margin">Too tite Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages.</note>

               </p>
               <p>In all theſe caſes it's very eaſie to ſee, that the mortification depends ſimply on the interruption of the courſe of the Blood, without the concurrence of any other cauſe; but you will ſee in what follows, how the ill diſpoſition of the Humours may augment, and even produce this kind of Gangrene.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene may happen by long lying on the Buttocks, &amp;c.</note>Secondly, a Gangrene happens often upon the Buttocks of thoſe who have had long Sickneſſes, and that are obliged to lie long on their Backs, firſt the <hi>Cutis</hi> begins to riſe, afterwards there happens Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Fleſh, which ends in Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneſs and Gangrene.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:110043:146"/>Veſſels in the part; but if at the ſame time the Patient involuntary ſheds his Water and Excrements the Gangrene comes ſooner, becauſe they gall and heat the parts by their acrimony, and ſo increaſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, and conſequently the Inflammation and Gangrene.</p>

Behold this is the period of Inflammations proper to produce a Gangrene; and as there muſt be great abundance of Blood to compreſs hard the Veſſels, ſo it happens only upon great Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. If I ſay that in great Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations the Extravaſated Blood com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:110043:146"/>the Veſſels, it's not a ſimple Imagination only, but a conſtant Truth; ſince the Pulſe ceaſes to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate, at the ſame time the part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to gangrenate, and it's red co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour grows pale, livid, and black; which clearly demonſtrate that the ſanguiferous Veſſels are compreſs'd, and the acceſs of new Blood hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</p>

               <p>To conceive this well, you muſt obſerve, that the Extravaſated Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors tranſpire very much, and that this Tranſpiration does extreamly diſcharge the diſeaſed part, of the quantity of Humours which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; ſo while the Pores are open in Phlegmons and Eriſipelaſes, and the moſt active and agitated particles of the Bile and Blood evaporate, the part always diſcharges it ſelf of ſome of its Burthen, ſo not much fear of Gangrene. This is the reaſon why in the Southern part of <hi>America</hi>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:110043:147"/>there never was ſeen a Gangrene come upon Wounds or Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe the great heat of the Countrey opens the Pores of the Body; but when the Pores are cloſed by Aſtringent, Repercuſſive, or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſtic Medicines, and the tranſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion utterly impeded in the part, the Tumour increaſes, the part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all thoſe particles which would have eſcaped through the Pores; the Extravaſated Humours being in a greater quantity, proportionable to the part which contains it, compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Fleſh and Veſſels, and of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity cauſeth a Mortification.</p>
               <p>Behold the true cauſe of Gangrene which comes upon Inflammations, Contuſions, Anevriſms, and Eriſipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las; all theſe cauſes have been very well obſerved by <hi>Ettmuller,</hi> when he ſays, <hi>Hinc eſt quod vix ſaepius oriuntur Gangrene, &amp; ſphaceli, quam ex Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mationibus male curatis, imprimis ſi partis Inflamatae; per Emplaſtica impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denter admota, impediatur inſenſilis tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiratio, tunc ſanguis extravaſatus ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat, corrumpitur, ex toto putreſcit, &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis Inflammate Gangrenam poſt ſe trahit.

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:110043:147"/>ac muilaginoſa inſulſae, tractata ſubito ſerpentem inducunt Gangrenam.</hi> But theſe cauſes having produced their effect, there are that augment it, and which give even occaſion that it be communicated to the nigh parts, it is the corruption of the Blood and Extravaſated Humours in a ſimple In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation. When the Blood is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travaſated, and cannot be diſcuſt, it changes into <hi>Pus;</hi> This change is not only cauſed by the action of the principles of the Extravaſated Blood, but alſo by the ſoft influence of the Blood and Spirits which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the neighbouring parts; This makes that the <hi>Pus</hi> is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together a ſtrange ſubſtance, and enemy to Nature. But as I have ſhew'd that the acceſs of the Blood is entirely preſs'd towards the Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gren'd parts, and the circulation very often intercepted, it ſo happens that the Extravaſated Blood is ſo far from being converted into <hi>Pus,</hi> that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates into a virulent Sanies, which firſt cauſeth Bliſters upon the part, and then by its acrimony gnaws the Gangrened parts, and inſenſibly corrupts thoſe that are ſound;
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:110043:148"/>which makes the Gangrene become ſo angry, that it attacks even the parts that ſuffer no Inflammation.

               <p>Every one knows that this Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is practiſed in great ſhatterings of the Bones, in old Ulcers and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula's of the Joynts; but it's firſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to examine the Nature of the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:110043:153"/>Wound; For Example, if the Bone be quite broke to pieces, if the Splints be engaged, and (as it were) forced down into the Fleſh, or among the Tendons; if they prick ſome Nerves or Sanguiferous Veſſels, ſo that they cannot be reſtor'd to their natural poſition, it would be neceſſary to try the Operation; but if the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent be not too great, and the pieces can be brought level again with the Bone, be no way alter'd, nor have cauſed any Inflammation, or pain; one might hope for its cure by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, unleſs ſome Joynt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. In a word, I ſay that all compound Wounds are of difficult cure, how inconſiderable ſoever the complication be, eſpecially there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any indiſpoſition in the ſubject. In this occaſion the Pain and Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the two Accidents moſt to be feared, particularly when they continue, and produce ſome more troubleſome, and when the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are preſſing, it's dangerous to delay, and very often the Operation it ſelf is not able to overcome them.</p>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:110043:154"/>
               <p>As for old Rottenneſs and Fiſtula's you muſt obſerve the ſame Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and have regard unto three things, to the Nature and Cauſe of the Diſeaſe, to the Part affected, and to the Supervening Symptomes.</p>
               <p>To judge whether the Fiſtula's, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are curable, and may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by Medicines, it's neceſſary to examine whether they have been of long continuance, the cauſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them, and that which foments them.</p>
               <p>If the Cauſe of the Rottenneſs and Fiſtula's proceed from ſome Wound or Contuſion, and the Patient have not been long troubled with it, if the Joynt be no way alter'd, and the Humours which foment them be not malign, Medicines may terminate the Cure. But if the Cauſe proceed from Scrophulous Humours, Critical Impoſthumations, or from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perverſion of the Humours, if they be old, ſettled in the Joynts; and finally, if the Rottenneſs, Callo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, Pain, and Inflammation be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable; In a word, if the part be no longer able to perform it's functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, you muſt have recourſe to the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:110043:154"/>Operation, provided the ſtrength of the Patient give leave; but before you put it in practice, you muſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the Maſs of Blood and Humours by general Remedies, as Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic's, and Cardiac's.</p>
               <p>I will not give you here an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Medicines which are employed as well Internally as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, to hinder the diſorder of the Gangrene, being obliged to ſpeak of them in a Treatiſe of Wounds, and as every kind of Gangrene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires particular and different Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, ſo it's the part of a prudent Chyrurgeon and Phyſician to order and uſe them according to their Idea's and Underſtandings.</p>

If it be the Arm you cut off, you muſt cut off as little of it as poſſible, becauſe the little that remains ſerves in a manner to the functions of Life: If it be the Leg, though only the Foot ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, you muſt Amputate 3 Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers below the Knee, juſt under the <hi>Aponevroſes</hi> which cover the <hi>Rotula,</hi> becauſe of the long ſuppurations
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:110043:155"/>which rot the Tendons, and other accidents that may happen; and to put on an Artificial one more eaſily.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Never Ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in the Joynt.</note>You muſt never amputate in the Joynts, unleſs it be in the Fingers or Toes, which we are obliged to take off. If it be the Thigh, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putate as little as you can, becauſe the more you cut the greater is the Wound, ſuppuration longer, and the cure more difficult, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Patient's ſtrength dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes, and grows more weak.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How to Ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</note>Having choſen a proper place, we perform the Operation thus. If it be the Leg, you place the Patient on the edge of a Bed, lying half back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, one ſuſtains him behind, a Servant claſps his two Hands about the inferior part of the Thigh, and draws the Skin upwards, another holds the Leg, whilſt the Surgeon puts on the Ham a Compreſs of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral folds, of a fitting bigneſs, with another pretty large Compreſs, which encompaſſes the whole part, upon which you place a Ligature, which muſt be ſtreightned with the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niket; but being it muſt be tied very hard, ſufficient to compreſs the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:110043:155"/>great Veſſels, you may place a Paſt-board under the Ligature, that the Patient may feel leſs pain, and for hindring the Skin from wrinkling; Then you make two other Ligatures, one over, and the other below; the firſt keeps the Skin which you raiſe upward, and the other faſtens the Fleſh; Then the Surgeon places himſelf between the Patients Legs, and with a crooked Knife which he holds in his Right Hand,<note place="margin">How to cut the Fleſh.</note> he makes an Inciſion about the Member even to the Bone, and with the Back of the Knife ſeparates the <hi>Perioſtium,</hi> and cuts at the ſame time the Fleſh and Membranes between the Bones, leſt you rend them with the Saw, and ſo cauſe new accidents; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſaw the Bones, you take a Fillet of Linnen which you ſplit in two parts, and you make uſe of it to raiſe the Fleſh, and to give liberty to ſaw the Bone as near to the Fleſh as poſſible; for ſeeing it waſtes and conſumes in ſuppuration, if this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution were not taken, there would ſtick out an end of the Bone deprived of Skin and Fleſh, which would ſerve for nothing but to incommode the Patient.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How to ſaw the Bone.</note>This being done, you take the Saw, which you carry obliquely over the <hi>Tibia,</hi> which alſo ſerves for a ſupport to ſaw the <hi>Fibula,</hi> which is the weaket; which obliges us to ſaw it before the <hi>Tibia,</hi> to avoid its crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſhivering.</p>
               <p>You muſt obſerve, that in the time of ſawing, the Servant muſt bend the Leg a little inward, that the Saw may paſs more eaſily. The two Bones being ſawed off, you take off the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature above, which held the Skin faſt, you looſe the Torniket; to find out the Artery, you take hold of it with the Crow's Bill,<note place="margin">How to tye the Artery.</note> or Pincers with a Ring, then you take a crooked Needle arm'd with Wax'd Thread, which you paſs twice into the Fleſh under the Artery, that it may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the Loop of the Ligature, which you tie very hard; you make a knot over the Artery, upon the knot you apply a little compreſs, which you faſten with two other knots, you again looſe the Torniket; If the Blood ſhould run out with any violence from any other Artery, you make another Ligature as the firſt.</p>

                  <note place="margin">To ſtop the Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhage in Wounds.</note>Being the Hemorrhage is the firſt and moſt dangerous Symptome of Wounds, it's that which the Surgeon muſt quickly correct, in cloſing the veſſels from whence the Blood flows. For if you ſtop them the Blood runs no more, that is to ſay, you muſt put into their Apertures ſome Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines which hinders the effuſion of the Liquors they contain, or in tying or compreſſing them. Theſe two laſt Methods are the ſureſt, becauſe one may order them as one pleaſe, ſo that the Intention for which we make the Ligature, or introduce Lint into a new Wound, is to hinder the flux of Blood, in preſſing the Lint a little to oblige the ſides of the Veſſels to approach, and reſiſt the Impulſion of the Blood, yet ſo that the Compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

                  <note place="margin">Cauſe of Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note>The Inflammation or Tumour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Circulation in the part being impeded, by the diviſion of the Veſſels, the Grumous cloded Blood, and the Dreſſings. Theſe ſtrange Bodies are as ſo many Sluces which oppoſe the courſe of the Blood, obliging it to ſtop and excite In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cauſe of Pulſative pain.</note>I conceive two ſorts of Pain.

                  <note place="margin">Cauſe of the quick and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pain.</note>The ſecond is a quick and burning Pain, cauſed by the ſuppreſſion of the courſe of the Blood, which by the motion and frequent ſhocks of its moſt active principles, burſts the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:110043:162"/>Veſſels, and extravaſateth between the poroſites of the Fleſh, where it's ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by the great quantity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centred Spirits, which penetrate the moſt inſenſible Poroſities. Then doth the Blood by its irregular action ſhake, and violently prick the little Nervous Fillaments, from whence proceeds this ſecond kind of burning pain.</p>

                  <note place="margin">2. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent pain.</note>We commonly prevent theſe two Accidents, by repreſſing the motions of the Blood, which comes to the part with too great precipitation, by Repercuſſives and gentle Aſtringents. Bandages are of the firſt rank, which we uſe very ſucceſsfully in binding the Wound up gently, as alſo the neighbouring parts; whereas too tite a compreſſion would augment the Inflammation. It's for this end we readily employ Defenſatives, as we call them, becauſe they are compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a Deſiccative Matter, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly ſhuts up the poroſities of the Veſſels, as <hi>Terra Sigillata &amp; Bole</hi> mixt with the White of an Egg, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water.</p>

It's eaſie to ſee, if one continues the uſe of Repercuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives, the ſalts endeavouring to eſcape, fail not to excite Inflammation, and to corrupt the nouriſhing Juice of the parts, in diſuniting the principles of the Blood, which depend one on another, &amp; which by the frequent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, and ſhock of their particles, change figure; from which depends the generation of a new Matter, and all the changes which happen.<note place="margin">Diſcuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note>If in ſuch an occaſion Diſcutients which cauſes perſpiration, and Digeſtives, which excites a quick ſuppuration, ſhould not work together to diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the part, it would tumifie ſo much as to fall into Gangrene.

               <p>We obſerve, that in great Wounds Diſcutients excite often a fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which increaſes the Inflammation: In that Caſe, a Cataplaſm made with Crums of Bread, Milk, the Yolk of an Egg, Mallow Roots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is very proper. We ordinarily blame thoſe who let the <hi>Pus</hi> lie too long in the Wound; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it always gets ſome malignity, &amp; corrodes the neighbouring Veſſels, which preſently produces Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; Putrefaction; or elſe the Veins abſorb it, &amp; carry it to the Heart, from whence it diffuſeth it ſelf into the whole Maſs of Blood, and cauſes the Fever; and according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent alterations which it receives in paſſing through the parts, it obſtructs the Liver, Lungs, or ſome other part, ſo cauſes an Impoſthume there, as we have obſerved in Wounds of the Head. This demonſtrates to us, that we ought to dry up all the Matter that is in the Wounds, and preſs the Doſſels into the leaſt corner, that the Matter may not lurk there. It's ſo true, that the Maſs of Blood takes up the purulent Matter in the time of its flay there,<note place="margin">Matter often ſeen mixt with the Blood.</note> that whenever you Bleed the Patient, you often find ſome <hi>Pus</hi> mixt with his Blood.</p>

               <p>If the part diſengages it ſelf by a copious ſuppuration, you prefer Compreſſes ſoaked in warm Wine before Cataplaſms, becauſe it fortifies the part.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Always after long Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous Fleſh grows.</note>It's obſerved, that after long ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purations, there always grows proud Fleſh, which is ſometimes taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by compreſſing the Wound a little; if this preſſure be not enough, we uſe <hi>Pul.

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:110043:165"/>which had been before relaxed by the Suppuratives, which had given room to the nouriſhing Juice by its overabundance to beget this fungous Fleſh.</p>
               <p>The Method is often changed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diſpoſition of the Wounded Subjects; for Example, elderly People, or thoſe that are lean and ſpare, have ordinarily their parts ſoft and looſe, becauſe a part of their heat is extinguiſhed; in this caſe the Phagedenic Water would be hurtful, becauſe in ſhutting the Pores too much, and not permitting their little heat to open them, the Wound would entirely dry up, Deterſive and Trau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Medicines ordinarily ſupply its default, becauſe there contain alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line particles; which deſtroy the acid of the Blood by inſenſibly open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the little mouths of the Veſſels, and charge themſelves with the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purative particles, which being unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them ſtick at their Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to regenerate new Fleſh; ſuch is the Spirit or Decoct. of theſe Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerary Plants,<note place="margin">Some choice Traumatic Plants.</note> as <hi>Rad.

Theſe Symples are charg'd with alkaline particles, which abſorb the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant acid, hinders the riſe of the Ever, and makes the Wound of a Vermilion hue.</p>
               <p>We obſerve according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Corruption, that when the Suppurative particles cannot accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate themſelves to the Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Veſſels without the help of ſome medium, we mix with the Traumatic Decoctions ſome things that have a kind of unctioſity in them, as <hi>Mel Roſat.</hi> which is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, eſpecially when the <hi>Pus</hi> is thin and fluid, whereas if it be thick we leſſen its quantity. If it be black and ſerous, it's a ſign that it is in the laſt degree of corruption. As in this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the Blood where Trau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics cannot maſter the Acids, we uſe ſucceſsfully a Spirit drawn from brown Sugar,<note place="margin">An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit for Wounds.</note> 
                  <hi>Vitriol Mart. &amp; Hep. Antim.</hi> which reſiſts all ſorts of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.</p>
               <p>This Spirit is charged with Balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic, Styptic, and Alkaline ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous ſalt particles: The Balſamie
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:110043:166"/>particles ſupple the Veſſels by their unctioſity, the Styptic fortifie them by their Aſtringency, and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaliſt ſalts blunt and maſter the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Acids by their poroſity. I think this method of dreſſing is to be preferr'd before that where they uſe greaſy Unguents, Plaiſters, and Balms without intermiſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Signs of good <hi>Pus.</hi>
                  </note> That the <hi>Pus</hi> be right, it muſt be of a moderate conſiſtence, white and without any ill ſmell. It often happens, that when we intend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy its acidity, there riſeth a ſoft fungous Fleſh, which depends on the great fermentation of the Acids and Alkalies, and when that fermentation ceaſes, that faint Fleſh is diſſipated only by compreſſion. Moſt Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, without any reflection, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently uſe burnt Alom, and if it work not faſt enough, they uſe red preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate, and if that performs no more than the other, they make a mixture of them, which may well be call'd the Diabolical Corroſive; it increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Pain, and renews the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; But to avoid the Impreſſion of ſuch a ſtrong Corroſive, you take the Traumatic Decoction, in which
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:110043:166"/>you diſſolve a Drachm or two of Calcin'd Vitriol, ſo you conſume in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>It's obſerved, that the Fleſh often grows hard, eſpecially when the part is too much loaded, or the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage too ſtrait, the motion of the Juices being intercepted, which muſt be avoided in all ſorts of Wounds; If the Fleſh be red, and granulate well, you muſt not preſs it, you introduce only into the Wound a pledgit of Lint wet in warm Wine or Brandy.</p>
               <p>You muſt never waſh Wounds, it's enough to dry them with Lint; If you are obliged to ſiringe them,<note place="margin">How to Siringe Wounds.</note> you muſt do it diſcreetly, becauſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection melts and diſſolves the Fleſh, ſo that inſtead of breeding good, it produces Fungous; in this caſe Lint only ſoaked in warm Wine ſufficeth, becauſe it cleanſes the Wound in drinking up the Impurities it finds there, unleſs there be ſome Sinuſes, which cannot be opened by reaſon of the Veſſels, Tendons, or thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſubſtance which we muſt be obliged to offend in making the Inciſion; then we uſe Injections when we cannot introduce Lint in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Sinuſes.</p>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:110043:167"/>
               <p>We always obſerve in Wounds certain white and hard places, which are nothing elſe but ſome broken Lymphatic Veſſels, and which moſt Practitioners take for the beginning of a Cicatrix; in that caſe Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water is uſeful to dry up the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Veſſels, and diſſipate the Glutinous particles of the <hi>Lympha,</hi> which produces ſome Fungus's to grow over the Veſſels.</p>
               <p>It's very important to diſtinguiſh this white mark from the extremity of the cut Nerve, for if one ſhould put on a Nerve any corroſive Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, it would excite an inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table pain, which it doth not here; beſides Experience Authoriſes it, as often as we carry off a Gland, and Lymphatic Veſſel of a Veneral Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo; there appears next morning a round and hard point, which cannot be conſumed without <hi>Pul. Vitreol. Rub.</hi> all other as <hi>Precep.</hi> and Allom burnt, &amp;c. work in vain. But that which is moſt ſurpriſing, is, that this Corroſive Powder which in 1000 oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions is inſupportable, is not felt at all in this.</p>
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:110043:167"/>
               <p>You muſt obſerve, that if ſome Limphatic Veſſel open in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a Wound, and ſpils the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha there, it fails not to turn Fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; this for the moſt part happens unforeſeen; in which caſe to cure the Fiſtula, you muſt open even to the Gland if poſſible, to deſtroy it, and drain the ſource of it. If you fear you ſhould not ſucceed this way, you muſt hinder the Veſſel from ſhedding the Lympha into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Wound by drying up its extremity, and procure the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Fleſh as faſt as you can.</p>
               <p>If a Wound be accompanied with contuſion, you muſt uſe the ſtrongeſt Diſcutients, as <hi>Spirit. Vini</hi> alone, or <hi>Aromatiſed,</hi> or <hi>a Lixivium,</hi> which ſhall be deſcribed in the Chapter of Wounds made with Fire-Arms.</p>
               <p>If the Matter diſcuſs not, and that it increaſes, you muſt diſingage the parts by Scarification, and uſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines which awaken the particles of the Blood that are at reſt; and force them out by perſpiration, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter again in commerce with the Liquors. This is the method which you muſt follow in great Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:110043:168"/>where the Gangrene is apt to ſucceed.</p>
               <p>The Medicines are the Decoction of the chiefeſt Vulneraries which we have recommended afore; The Tinctures of Aloes, Olibanum Myrrh made with the Spirit of Wine, all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines where the preparations of Mercury enter, Urine, Sea Water, Cataplaſms made with Meal of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pins, Beans and Lentiles, Tops of Wormwood, and Scordium boiled in Oximel Simp. Theſe are the chiefeſt Remedies which are to be employed in deep Scarifications; ſome deſtroy and blunt the Acids, ſome ſweeten and correct the Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Lixivial ſalts, others ſtrengthen the part, and all together contribute to retain the ſpirituous par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles which are ready to eſcape, or to diſengage them when concentred, and produce a fermentation which ſeparates the Morbid Leavens, and reſtores the heat and ſpirits again into the part.</p>
               <p>If a great flux of Blood follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Wound, or if any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Veſſel be opened, you muſt make the Ligature if the place per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:110043:168"/>or uſe the Vitriolic Button, or ſome Styptic Water, as that in Mr. <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery</hi>'s Chymiſtry, and ſome drops of Spirit of Turpentine.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">When to dilate the Wound.</note>If the Orifice of the Wound per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not the entry of your Doſſels, you muſt dilate it, avoiding the great Veſſels and Tendons. This is the ſureſt and moſt important practice to ſucceed in all Wounds, where one cannot apply Boulſters, becauſe in diſcovering the bottom of the Wound you have the advantage to uſe Boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and reject the uſe of Tents, which are only Beneficial in deep Wounds of the Thorax and Belly; you may alſo better wipe the leſſer corners of the Wound, fill it with Doſſels, and hinder the Matter from cakeing or lodging it ſelf in any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and to hinder the formation of any <hi>Sinus.</hi> I have made you obſerve, that many Compreſſes, and too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Bandages, are kinds of Ligature which ſtop the courſe of the Blood, and which increaſe the fluxion, and all other accidents.</p>

Theſe two Accidents do alſo ſignifie the neceſſity that there is to dilate it, for to carry Remedies to the part, and give a greater vent to the Matter, we moſt commonly introduce two Tents of Lint of a length and thickneſs proportionable to the Orifices, we faſten Threads to them, and dip them in ſome Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtive made of <hi>Ol.

               <p>If the <hi>Pus</hi> be good, and the moſt intimate parts re-unite themſelves, you muſt continue this Method; but if it be black, and Inflammation ſucceed, Phlebotomy, reiterated Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and cooling and opening Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans muſt not be neglected, we cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Digeſtives with <hi>Ol.

               <p>If notwithſtanding theſe precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Inflammation incroaches upon the neighbouring parts, with putrefaction, you muſt dilate it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently to diſcover the place where the Matter lodges; by this means you diſcharge the part, and dreſs all the corners where the Matter for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly was neſtling, and ſo prevent Gangrene and Mortification.</p>

               <p>Though a Wound goes not through and through, yet if the Probe enters almoſt through the part, you muſt without delay make an Inciſion on the oppoſite ſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes which commonly attend Punctur'd Wounds.</note>The moſt frequent Symptomes that happen in theſe kinds of Wounds, are Fever and Looſeneſs, upon which ſometimes follows Dyſentery.</p>
               <p>The Fever excites Inflammation, and retards Suppuration, that the part becomes ſo tumified, that a Gangrene often follows it. It's known that the different dgrees of the Fever rule thoſe of the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as theſe do them of the Gangrene. Bleeding, Clyſters, Sweet and Liquid Food, Emollient and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutient Cataplaſms made of the four
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:110043:171"/>Meals, Honey, and the Emollient Herbs boil'd in Wine, as <hi>Fol. Malve, Altheae, Seneſſionis, Violar. Rarietariae, Candilariae, Chamomillae, Meliot. &amp;c.</hi> All theſe Medicines are very Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious here.</p>
               <p>You muſt obſerve to let the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſms be very moiſt leſt they dry up; and ſo inſtead of Humecting and Mollifying the Fibres, they obſtruct the Pores as Aſtringents, and hinder Tranſpiration.</p>
               <p>If in ſpight of all this care the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation goes not off, you relieve the part by ſome ſlight Scarificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; if they be not enough, you make others deeper, that the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines may have room to work.</p>
               <p>If the Wound be ſuperficial, you muſt dilate it; but if it penetrate even to the moſt intimate parts, I mean near the great Veſſels or Bones, you muſt keep to Scarifications, and Injections made of Traumatic Plants, <hi>Mel. Roſar.</hi> and Spirit of Wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you would be apt to ruine the whole part by the Inciſion, which muſt afterwards be cut off.</p>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:110043:172"/>
               <p>It often happens, that the Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene comes on the ſides of theſe kinds of Wounds, where the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is always moſt conſiderable, in which caſe your Pleagets muſt be well charg'd with Digeſtives:</p>
               <p>If the Inflammation goes not off either by Suppuration or Tranſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the red colour of the Skin changes not, you muſt uſe ſtrong Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turative Cataplaſms of White Lilly Roots, Sorrel, Leaven, and the common Digeſtive, provided the Inflammation communicates it ſelf not to the adjacent parts.</p>
               <p>Scarifications are not to be uſed but when the part is extreamly ſtretched, and the red colour changed into a livid, and when little Bliſters ariſe which ſignifies a beginning Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and ſhews that the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Gangrene is very acid and malignant; you muſt not ſtay till theſe little Bliſters increaſe, but as ſoon as you ſee that the Wound doth not ſuppurate, and the Skin changes colour, you ought to Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie, and lay Compreſſes upon the neighbouring parts, ſoak'd in warm Wine and Brandy.</p>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:110043:172"/>
               <p>The Fever is ſometimes extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by Scarification, becauſe the Agitated Matter of the Acid ferment hath room to eſcape; ſo the Inflammation is diminiſhed, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration procured, and the progreſs of Putrefaction ſtopped.</p>
               <p>If the Lips of the Wound be of a Vermilion colour, it's a token that the ſalt particles prick the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, and increaſe the Fluxion; it excites the Fever a-new for ſome time, and the edges of the Wound grow white and dry. This change proceeds from the ſalt Juices, which by their too great motion ſeparate themſelves from the ſulphurous ones, ſo that they irrigate the Fibres, and cauſe a new Obſtruction, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards makes the Fleſh foggy and white.</p>
               <p>We often obſerve, that though the Wound be often ready to Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triſe, yet if the Fever ariſes a-new, it grows bigger and more dangerous than it was before, becauſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation makes a greater progreſs, in this caſe you touch the new form'd Skin with <hi>Aq. Calcis,</hi> in which ſome <hi>Mercurius Sublimat.</hi> has been diſſolved;
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:110043:173"/>but without uſing any remedy you may cut it off, for the ferment of that Membrane infects the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring parts. Balſam of Sulphur is very good in this occaſion, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ſmall Putrefactions.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Flux a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.</note>If a Flux come upon a Fleſh Wound, it's a very dangerous ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, becauſe it only happens when the ſalt particles have left the part, and enter into the Maſs of Liquors. Now as the Volatil ſalts maintain the motion of the Blood and other Humours, and have a vertue of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving and making them fluid, we are to ſearch no where elſe the cauſe of this Symptome. This Flux hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Suppuration, and weakens the Sick more than all other accidents together, becauſe of the great diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Spirits that is made by the Stools. We alſo obſerve, that the Wound dries, ſhrivels, and becomes as it were mortified, according as the Spirits abandon it; and the ſtronger the Flux is, the more the Inflammation leſſens, the Fleſh dries up, and the part becomes more faint, aduſt and putrid. You muſt foment it with Aromatic Wines, and hinder
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:110043:173"/>the diſunion of the ſalts by the help of Balſam of Sulphur; but from the moment that the Spirits exalt themſelves towards the ſurface, the motion of the Blood ſlackens, the Flux ceaſeth, and the Wound which before was inanimate as it were, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives again.</p>
               <p>This Flux muſt be ſtopt with great Circumſpection, for it's a ſign that the ſalts are become very acid, ſince they offend every part where they lie; you muſt always ſtop it by degrees, for fear a ſudden ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion might again revive the Fever, and render it more malignant and pernicious, which would preſently unite Putrefaction with Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Flux being ſtopt, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient muſt be fed with ſweet and thick Food.</p>
               <p>The proper Medicines for ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping a Flux are Clyſters made of White Broth, Mallows, Bran, Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, Knot-graſs, and the Yolk of Eggs. Tiſans made of Bugle, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle, Lemons, and Liquoriſh, are alſo of great help.</p>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:110043:174"/>
               <p>We obſerve, that this Flux hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens oftner in great Hoſpitals, than any where elſe, eſpecially in great Wounds, becauſe the Wounded re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there an Air loaden with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign and Peſtilential Vapours, which not only cauſes the Looſeneſs, but all the other troubleſome Accidents which follow upon it.</p>
               <p>We obſerve, that the Wounds which happen to the Legs are moſt dangerous, or of difficult cure, but ſince the Circulation being more flow in them, their Tendons and Membranes ſtretched, and their Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicles more narrow, this diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of parts cauſes the Humours to ſettle and employ themſelves more eaſily, and that only the ſeroſity is able to diſengage it ſelf in time of their ſettlings, by its abode changes into a Virulent Sanies, which enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Wounds of theſe hard and callous parts. They alſo require ſome Medicines capable of carrying off, and melting the Calloſity, and deſtroying the Sanies which is the chief cauſe of it.</p>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:110043:174"/>
               <p>When Wounds are of difficult cure, and as it were unconquerable with Medicines, it's the evil diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Subject for the moſt part which contributes to it. Some are naturally of an Ill Habit, others affected with ſome Venerial Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, or ſome other as bad; Finally, others do not govern themſelves, and have a greater inclination for that which is hurtful to them, and which is capable of heating and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering their Blood; If in theſe kinds of Inconveniencies the Medicines which we have uſed produce not any effect, Cardiac's and Medicines of a Purifying Quality favours their cure;<note place="margin">What to be uſed in Venomous Wounds.</note> as all Aromatic's, Cordial Potions, all Preparations of Mercury and Antimony, Theriac, Confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Powder of Vipers, with their Volatil Salt, Volatil ſalt of Hearts-horn, and ſeveral Medicines of the ſame Nature, which differently, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different degrees of Corruption.</p>
               <p>This is the Practice which muſt be followed in Venomous Wounds, having applied upon the part all things that reſiſt Mortification.

               <p>I Have made you obſerve, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Suture of the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, that when it's quite cut, there happens no troubleſome accident but that it retires towards its Origine, and that one is obliged to ſoften their Fibres with Oyls drawn without Fire, that their reunion may be the eaſier.</p>
               <p>I have alſo made you obſerve, that the Stitch being made, it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Humect the Tendon with Oyl and Spirit of Wine, the Oyl reſiſts the Impreſſions of the Air, and the Spirit of Wine penetrating the leaſt Poroſities, deobſtructs their Channels in driving out the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and by this means the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:110043:175"/>of Symptomes, particularly that of Pain is ſtop'd. Suppuratives muſt follow next immediately, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as they hinder that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation may not cauſe long ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration, which would infallibly rot the Tendons in ſpight of all the care that might be taken, as it happens in all great Fluxions, where the Tendons are diſcovered. This is the reaſon which obliges us to ſtay till the Suppuration be accompliſhed, and the Tendon covered, before we uſe Diſſicatives, as <hi>Tinct. Aloes, Spirit. Vini,</hi> with ſeveral others, becauſe in drying the part too ſoon you hinder the diſſolution of the Juice, ſtops Suppuration, and retains the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which is the true cauſe why the Tendon rots.</p>
               <p>The Inflammation which comes upon Wounds of the Tendons that lie but ſhallow under the Skin, is not dangerous, but ſince the Juice which exudes out of it is corroſive, it awakes the Pain and all other Accidents which moſt commonly attend Wounds of the Tendons. But if it happen that a deep Tendon be hurt, the Inflammation and Obſtructions
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:110043:176"/>are greater, and more troubleſome, by reaſon of the many Sanguin Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels which lie over it.</p>
               <p>If the Accidents continue, and the Tendon ſuppurates not, it's moſt convenient to dilate the Wound, that the Remedies may be able to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, and eaſe the part by cauſing a ſpeedy ſuppuration.</p>
               <p>If the Fleſh which is generated in theſe kinds of Wounds become cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, it's a ſign that the ſalt abounds every where, and that the fluxions will be great, ſince the ſalt particles condenſe themſelves in the very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the part. We uſe only here Digeſtives and Balſams which are convenient till the Wounds be ready to cicatriſe, being capable of melting and diſſolving the Juices, by which we know that Diſſicatives are noxious becauſe they procure too ſoon a Cicatrix.</p>
               <p>There's ſometimes generated a ſoft ſpongy Fleſh, which threatens the part with great Obſtruction; then it's alſo neceſſary to continue the Digeſtives; for Diſſicatives glue and harden too much the nouriſhing particles, and augment the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:110043:176"/>of the ſalts which cauſe faulty Fleſh. In this caſe <hi>SCHRODER's</hi> Green Balm is excellent.</p>
               <p>You muſt obſerve, that a Tendon may be hurt by a prick without any accident happening. This is when the Inſtrument ſlips between the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of the Fibres without enda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maging them. But if by chance it divides ſome of the Fibres, Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions follow, which occaſions the nouriſhing Juice to become corroſive, gnawing the Fibres and Membranes, which cauſes a greater Obſtruction, &amp; more violent Pain; Beſides the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which are irritated by theſe ſharp Matters augment the Inflammation, which at firſt is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>nſiderable, but afterwards very dangerous.</p>
               <p>To help this inconvenience, you ought without ſcruple to open the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Fleſh to find the place of the prick'd Tendon, and to ſweeten the Acrimony of the ſalts with <hi>Ol. Ovor. Cere,</hi> and <hi>Spirit. Vini,</hi> not neglecting at the ſame time the uſe of Digeſtives and Balms. If the Accidents ceaſe not, it's a ſign the Puncture is deep, and that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments cannot penetrate; then
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:110043:177"/>you muſt ſeparate dexterouſly the Fibres of the Tendon according to their length, to give way to the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamic Particles to ſoften the Fibres, and the Spirit of Wine to diſcuſs the Humours, and cauſe a more eaſie Suppuration.</p>
               <p>The Inflammation which follows upon the Puncture of a Tendon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaches often upon the near parts; as for Example, if the Tendon of the Finger be prickt, the Wriſt and Arm ſwell ſo much, that one is often obliged to Amputate it. For ſeeing the Tendon and Belly of the Muſcle contain nothing but a heap of Fibres of the ſame continuity, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> conſequently the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation communicates it ſelf not only to the Belly of the Muſcle, but alſo to all the neighbouring parts. You muſt not be aſtoniſhed if theſe parts have ſuch a correſpondence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and if they communicate ſo mutually one to another their alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. If there be any difference between the Tendon and the Belly of the Muſcle, it conſiſts only in their Texture, and in the more or leſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, Tention, or Pain.</p>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:110043:177"/>
               <p>The moſt Specific Remedies to ſtop the Accidents of a Punctured Tendon, is to give iſſue to the Wound. If the Tendon lie high, we uſe Balſamic's and Digeſtives; but if deep, you muſt add Spirit of Wine; if the fluxion be great, you apply upon the Tendon a little Boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſoaked in Brandy, to ſecure it from the impreſſion of the Purulent Matter. As concerning Cataplaſms it's known, that we apply Emollients, Diſcutients, and Defenſatives, during the firſt 2 or 3 days, according to the degrees of the Inflammation, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards we prefer Diſcutients, which are continued all the time of the Fluxion; and during the reſt of the Cure you muſt uſe Plaiſters and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes ſoaked in Spirit of Wine warm'd.</p>
               <p>If the Tendon of the Hand be hurt, we lay not only Defenſatives upon the part, but alſo over the whole Arm. If the Puncture be made with a ſquare or triangular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, it's doubtleſs more to be feared than that which is made by a flat or round one, becauſe of the great number of the diviſions; it
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:110043:178"/>therefore requires more Circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Laſtly, if the Inflammation be great, and there be appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a Gangrene, you muſt Scarifie, and uſe all that is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to awake the motion of the Spirits.</p>

               <p>The Purulent Hmour corrupts and infects it, the Acid pricks and gnaws it, and the Viſcous obſtructs, and makes it immovable; It's doubtleſs by reaſon of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of their principles which deſtroy one another in the actions of the Medicaments, which cauſes them to be of ſo difficult a cure, and ſo hard to prevent the Ligaments from rotting.</p>
               <p>We have made you obſerve in the Examination of the Fiſtula in <hi>Ano,</hi> that Wounds of the Joynts often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into Fiſtula's, becauſe the ſalt Juice abounds there from every part, and the <hi>Pus</hi> changes into a ſharp and malignant Sanies, which filters into the Poroſities of the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Fibres of the part, making the Ulcer callous and fiſtulous; This Humour becomes ſometimes ſo biting, that it deſtroys not only the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons and Ligaments, but gnaws alſo the Cartilages, and cauſes a Cario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the Bones.</p>
               <p>To prevent all this, you muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſame Method which we have preſcribed in Wounds of the Tendons, that is to ſay, you muſt
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:110043:179"/>uſe every thing that tempers, ſweetens, and is capable to correct the acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the ſalts.</p>
               <p>When the Wound hath run well for ſome days, and the ſwelling of the part a little gone down, you uſe a Balm made of Ox-gall,<note place="margin">An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine in Wounds of the Joynts, &amp;c.</note> Spirit of Wine, and <hi>Mel. Roſat.</hi> which hath the faculty of diſcuſſing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving the Coagulate Matters. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner you prevent the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſity of the Wound, and all other accidents; We commonly Cicatriſe with Humecting Medicaments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Diſſicatives make it deform'd.</p>
               <p>The Bones differ from the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons and Ligaments, in that their Contexture is more thick, cloſe, and compact, and are nouriſhed with a more ſalt and ſubtil Juice.</p>
               <p>If the Wounds which happen to them be ſimple, the ſole reduction of the Pieces maintained by Bandages is ſufficient to cure them.</p>
               <p>If the Fractured Bones preſs ſome Veſſel or Tendon, and the Contuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be conſiderable, if you differ the reduction, the part falls into a Gangrene and Mortifies.</p>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:110043:180"/>
               <p>If ſome pieces of the Bone be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, ſo that you cannot reduce them, you muſt make an Inciſion to pull them out. I know that this happens very ſeldom, and the Splin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters muſt the very much intangled in the Fleſh, if they cannot be reduced without Inciſion.</p>
               <p>If the Bones be quite broke to pieces, and ſome great Veſſels lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, you muſt cut off the Limb.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak not here of the Dreſſings which are uſed in all ſorts of Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures; I only recommend to you that the Bones be tied harder where broke, then any where elſe, to keep them reduced, and to hinder the Callus from growing too abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</p>
               <p>We know that Compound Wounds comprehend both thoſe of the Fleſh and Bones, and that beſides the 18 tail Bandage, they require the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of ſeveral different Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. We uſe in the beginning Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutient Cataplaſms, to evacuate part of the Matter by Tranſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:110043:180"/>
               <p>You muſt by all means Suppurate, becauſe we are obliged to wait for the generation of the Callus, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foliation of the Bone, beſides a great Suppuration alters the Bones in a very little time.</p>
               <p>It's therefore neceſſary that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutients be uſed in ſtead of Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives, and if in the firſt days we uſe Digeſtives, Spirit of Wine and Hony muſt exceed, you apply dry Lint upon the Bone till the Callus be form'd, and after it's generation you apply Boulſters on it, ſoaked in Spirit of Wine, in which <hi>Sal. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac.</hi> and Camphire has been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, which is a moſt excellent Medicine to cure Ulcers of the Bone, and to haſten Exfoliation.</p>
               <p>You muſt obſerve, that there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver grows good Fleſh upon a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Bone, or that which is ready to exfoliate; It's always ſpongy, and one may ſay, that whenever they are of ſuch a nature, it's a certain ſign that the Bone muſt needs Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foliate, which moſt ordinarily hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in long Suppurations.</p>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:110043:181"/>
               <p>The formation of the <hi>Callus</hi> grows according to the Patients way of Living; It's obſerved, that it grows too much, and renders the part unequal, when the Patient eats too plentifully, and when they uſe too ſpare a Diet, it grows not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to reunite the part.</p>
               <p>The Prognoſtic's of Compound Wounds are always very dangerous to Cachectical Perſons, Old, and Pox't, whoſe Bones rot oftentimes without any Wound coming upon them.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of Gunſhot Wounds.</head>
               <p>GUnſhot Wounds are always ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous, as well by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great Contuſion which accompanies them for the moſt part, as becauſe the paſſages of the Blood are utterly ſtopped.</p>
               <p>We know that the Bullet's paſſing through a part ſcatters the ſubſtance, and breaks the Veſſels without any
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:110043:181"/>Hemorrhagy, or Suppuration before three, four, five, or ſometimes ſix days; the age, temperament, and nature of the part regulate theſe accidents; the reaſon of it is grounded upon the great agitation of the Bullet, and upon its round and blunt figure, that enters with ſo much force and ſwiftneſs into the Fleſh, bruiſeth and cruſhes the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, ſo that it forceth their Tunicles to glue themſelves to one another, and ſo oppoſes the flux of Blood, unleſs ſome great Veſſel be broke, and the Blood force a paſſage by its Impulſion.<note place="margin">Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction great in Gunſhot Wounds.</note> Of all Wounds there's none where the Obſtruction is greater than in theſe, and which conſequently are more capable of Inflammation and Gangrene.</p>
               <p>The contain ſeveral Particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to which the Chyrurgeon ought to give his attention; The firſt is, to conſider whether they be in any of the Venters, or the Limbs; if ſuperficial or penetrating; if the Bullet hath paſſed through and through; if it has touched ſome important part tending to the functions of Life in its paſſage,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:110043:182"/>which may be known by the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſymptomes.</p>
               <p>But whether it has paſſed through, or found ſome obſtacle in its paſſage, it's well known, that theſe kinds of Wounds are almoſt always accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with troubleſome accidents,<note place="margin">Accidents accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Gunſhot Wounds.</note> as rupture of ſome Veſſel, fracture of a Bone, or Contuſion, which is of leaſt conſequence.</p>
               <p>If the Orifice of the Wound be of a round figure, and grown leſs by the fluxion; the firſt Intention which you muſt ſatisfie is to dilate it; you excite by that means Suppurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and procure a more equal. Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice; you diſcharge the part in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Wound bleed as much as is convenient, and prevent accidents. But firſt it's important to extract the Bullet, if you can, ſince it is its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs which marks the place which is to be dilated. If you cannot fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the track which it has taken without making an Inciſion,<note place="margin">How to extract the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let.</note> you put the Patient into the ſame poſture he was in when wounded, that you may eaſier trace the Bullet, and obſerve the place where it ſtops; you after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards dilate the Wound, minding
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:110043:182"/>two Circumſtances;
<list>
                     <item>1. You muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the great Veſſels;</item>
                     <item>2. You muſt not diſcover the Tendons of the Joynts without neceſſity.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>If the Bullet be engaged near ſome great Veſſels,<note place="margin">When to leave the Bullet in.</note> or in the middle of the Muſcles, ſo that it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted without cauſing ſome ill effect, you may leave it in the part, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Patient be not much incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded with it. If it be in any of the Venters, you muſt leave it to Nature. If it ſtick in the Bones, you muſt gently move it, to draw it out more eaſily; becauſe the Bone would of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity putrifie. If it be in the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous parts, as in the Joynts, you muſt haſten its extraction, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly when it's ſharp, or of any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Matter, for then you muſt not only extract it from the Nervous parts, but every part whatever.</p>
               <p>You extract the ſtrong Bodies by Attraction, or by Impulſion, with the Hand, Inſtruments or Medicines ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the part they lie in. If, for Example, a Bullet be paſſed the great Veſſels, you will be obliged to extract it from the oppoſite part; but if it be on this ſide, you extract it through its entrance.</p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:110043:183"/>
               <p>Nevertheleſs that general Rule hath its exception, for if ſome ſtrange Body be upon the <hi>Carpus</hi> or <hi>Tarſus</hi> forc't from without inward, and ſhould have paſſed the Bones; It would be a great temerity to Inciſe the bending Tendons of the Fingers, to force a paſſage through the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite. In that caſe you muſt extract it by the ſame way it went it.</p>
               <p>If the Bullet has ruin'd a Joynt, you muſt cut off the part, becauſe the Ligaments and Bones being quite ſplit to pieces, and their Splinters irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the Tendons; it cauſes a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene to ſeize preſently on the part.</p>
               <p>If the Bone of the Thigh be broken, you muſt dilate the Wound as much as is convenient, and advance the Suppuration, that you may have the liberty of extracting ſome pieces of the ſeparate Bones, if there be any; Of the reſt you follow the ſame method as in other Compound Wounds.</p>
               <p>If there be any Veſſels open'd, as the Subclavian Veſſels, you make the Ligature; and if ſome Blood be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed upon the Diaphragm, you muſt come to the Operation of <hi>Empiema.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="341" facs="tcp:110043:183"/>
               <p>If the Bullet has carried off a great part of the Bone, as we cannot cut proportionably ſo much Fleſh as the ſubſtance of the Bone loſt; for to convey Remedies thither, it happens that the Fleſh that grows over it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes callous, and ſometimes oſſified, foraſmuch as the ſalt Juice which runs this way hardens it by little and little.</p>
               <p>If the Trunk of a great Veſſel be opened, we are often obliged to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putate the part, becauſe the part which receives no more Blood for its nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment Gangrenates. If the Wound be only in the Fleſh, you may bath it preſently after the firſt dreſſing with Brandy, you ſoak Boulſters in it, and bind up the part with Compreſſes ſoaked in warm Wine, ſtrengthen'd with Spirit of Wine.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Accidents which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</note>The chiefeſt accidents that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Gunſhot Wounds, are Tumours, Putrefaction, and Hemorrhagy, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate the ſwelling we ſucceſsfully uſe Traumatic Fomentations mixt with Spirit of Wine, or Cataplaſms made of Urine, Rye Meal, Hony, and Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Roſes, or a Lye made of Vine-Aſhes, in which you diſſolve <hi>Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac,</hi>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:110043:184"/>and Brandy; If the Tumour be not big, Suppuration is enough to carry it off; If it be accompanied with hardneſs, you make ſome ſlight Scarifications.</p>
               <p>To excite Suppuration in theſe kinds of Wounds, you uſe a Digeſtive made of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngt. Baſilicon, Linament. Arcei, Ol. ovor. &amp; Spirit. Vini;</hi> If Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption be joined, you add <hi>Theriac. Myrrh, Aloes, Sal Armoniac. Ol. Abſinth. &amp; Anthi;</hi> as you fear the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you animate them the more.</p>
               <p>If the Putrefaction happen to a fleſhy and ſpongy part, you diſſolve <hi>Egyptiac.</hi> in Spirit of Wine, and mix it with the Digeſtive.<note place="margin">Egyptiac not to be uſed in Nervous parts.</note> For <hi>Egyptiac.</hi> being entirely a Diſſicative, if it were uſed in Nervous parts, that are wont to dry up, it would diſſipate the little humidity that remains there. If you uſe Injections, it's beſt to uſe the two Ariſtolochias boiled in White Wine, in which you diſſolve Sugar Candy, Camphire, Myrrh, and Theriac.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Bitter things not to be uſed in Injections of the Breaſt.</note>You muſt obſerve, that Injections as well as other Remedies muſt be managed with prudence according to the parts where they are uſed. <hi>Ex. Gr.</hi> If you Inject into the Breaſt
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:110043:184"/>of one troubled with an <hi>Empiema</hi> a bitter and ſharp Liquor, it would irritate the part, ſo that they would augment the accidents; in the like occaſion we uſe with good ſucceſs a Decoction of Barley, Agrimony, a very little Wormwood, and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taury, Plantain, Birthwort, in which you diſſolve <hi>Mel. Roſar.</hi> If this needs to be fortified, you boil them in Whitewine or Brandy.</p>
               <p>The Tincture of <hi>Perſicaria Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culata</hi> made with White wine, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo good to reſiſt Putrefaction; if you intend to make it ſtronger, you diſſolve Myrrh, Aloes, and <hi>Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac</hi> in Brandy; and mix with it the Solution of <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> in Spirit of Wine, which produces the ſame effect; and to hinder the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of new Corruption, you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs the Dreſſing with Spirit of Wine Camphorated; The Solution of a <hi>Drachm</hi> of <hi>Mercurius</hi> ſublimate, or Arſnic in half a Pint of Spirit of Wine is excellent in great Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions; or one Ounce of <hi>Mercury</hi> in two Ounces of <hi>Aquafortis,</hi> which we mix with Lime Water or Brandy.</p>
               <pb n="344" facs="tcp:110043:185"/>
               <p>We alſo uſe with very good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in theſe occaſions, the Solution of the Canſtic Stone in Brandy, which we mix with the ſame quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Spirit of Wine Camphorat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. All theſe Solutions are capable to waſte and ſeparate putrified and rotten Fleſh, and alſo to conſume the Carioſity of Bones.</p>
               <p>After the effect of all theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, you uſe Detorſive Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made of red Roſes, <hi>Conſolid. Maj. Quinqueſolium,</hi> Plantain, Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Nettles, Pimpernell, Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winckle, St. <hi>Johns</hi> Wort, Purſlain, Plantain, and Poppy Seed; with which you ſlightly ſiringe the Wound, ſo ſeparate the reſt of the Impurities that are there.</p>
               <p>When you uſe Deterſives, you ordinarily joyn Suppuratives with them, as Turpentine, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent. ex apto, Balſam. Arcei, &amp; Ol. Hype<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rici.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Wound has long ſuppurat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Fleſh grows Luxuriant, you conſume it with the Spirit of Sulphure put in the Mundificative; If it be the Humidity of the part,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:110043:185"/>which cauſes this proud Fleſh to grow, inſtead of the Mundificative, you uſe Allom Water, or the <hi>Aq.
